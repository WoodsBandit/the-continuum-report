## Detailed Findings

### 1. Jeffrey Epstein — MINOR ISSUE

#### Structure ✅
- [x] "ANALYTICAL BRIEF — EDITORIAL COMMENTARY" header present
- [x] Opinion disclaimer present at top
- [x] Document Classification table present
- [x] Statement of Public Interest section exists

#### Fact/Opinion Separation ✅
- [x] "The Public Record" contains ONLY quotes + citations
- [x] "Editorial Analysis" exists and is clearly labeled
- [x] Opinion-signaling language used ("appears, in our assessment," "We view," "Our editorial judgment")

#### Liability Shields ⚠️
- [x] "Alternative Interpretations" section exists
- [ ] **ISSUE: Only 4 alternatives listed (minimum 5-7 required)**
- [x] "Right of Response" invitation included
- [x] "Methodology and Limitations" section exists

#### Sensitive Content ✅
- [x] Criminal charge status prominently noted ("Deceased; convicted sex offender (2008); died in custody August 2019")
- [x] No rhetorical questions implying wrongdoing
- [x] No loaded terminology presented as fact

#### Source Citations ✅
- [x] Source Documents table present
- [x] Citations include document identifiers and dates
- [x] Factual claims have corresponding citations

**Recommended Fix:** Add 1-3 additional alternative interpretations to meet the 5-7 minimum. Possible additions:
- The scope of Epstein's financial activities and their legitimacy
- The extent to which documented associates were aware of illegal activity
- Questions about institutional failures vs. individual culpability

### 2. Glenn Dubin — COMPLIANT

#### Structure ✅
All four required structural elements present.

#### Fact/Opinion Separation ✅
Clean separation maintained. Editorial Analysis clearly labeled with consistent opinion-signaling language.

#### Liability Shields ✅
- 5 substantive alternative interpretations provided
- Right of Response included
- Methodology and Limitations comprehensive

#### Sensitive Content ✅
- **Exemplary:** "Never charged with any crime; no allegations of misconduct in analyzed documents" — prominent and unambiguous
- **Exemplary:** Fifth Amendment disclaimer explicitly states invocation "reflects Marcinkova's legal strategy, not information about Dubin"
- No loaded terminology

#### Source Citations ✅
Complete and properly formatted.

**Notes:** This brief demonstrates best-practice legal framework implementation. The treatment of the Fifth Amendment invocation and the "never charged" prominence should serve as the model for similar profiles.

### 3. Lesley Groff — COMPLIANT

#### Structure ✅
All four required structural elements present.

#### Fact/Opinion Separation ✅
Clean separation. Editorial Analysis appropriately cautious given thin evidence base.

#### Liability Shields ✅
- 5 substantive alternative interpretations provided
- Right of Response included
- Methodology and Limitations appropriately emphasizes evidentiary gaps

#### Sensitive Content ✅
- "Never criminally charged; named as unindicted co-conspirator in 2008 NPA" — clear and balanced
- No Fifth Amendment references requiring disclaimer
- No loaded terminology
- Appropriate epistemic humility throughout

#### Source Citations ✅
Complete and properly formatted.

**Notes:** Strong application of framework under conditions of limited evidence. The repeated acknowledgment that the documentary record is "too thin" to support conclusions demonstrates proper legal caution.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required

| Brief | Action | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Jeffrey Epstein | Add 1-3 alternative interpretations | LOW |

### No Action Required

| Brief | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Glenn Dubin | No changes needed — use as template for similar profiles |
| Lesley Groff | No changes needed |

### Framework Notes

1. **Alternative Interpretations Standard:** The minimum of 5-7 alternatives should be enforced consistently. The Epstein brief's 4 alternatives, while substantive, falls below threshold.

2. **Fifth Amendment Handling:** The Dubin brief's disclaimer language should be templated for any future briefs referencing Fifth Amendment invocations.

3. **Thin Evidence Profiles:** The Groff brief demonstrates proper handling of subjects with limited documentary evidence — emphasize limitations rather than draw speculative conclusions.

---

## Conclusion

The legal framework is holding. The 15 rebuilt briefs appear to maintain consistent compliance with minor deviation. The one issue found (Epstein alternative interpretations count) is low-risk and easily remediated.

**Framework Status:** GREEN
