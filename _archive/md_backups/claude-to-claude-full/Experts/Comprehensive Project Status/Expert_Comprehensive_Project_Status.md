## The Project: The Continuum Report

**What it is:** An independent investigative journalism platform documenting connections within the Epstein network through an interactive web-based knowledge graph.

**Tagline:** "Another Node in the Decentralized Intelligence Agency"

**Live site:** thecontinuumreport.com

**Core mission:** Make verification trivially easy. Every claim independently verifiable within 30 seconds through clickable citations to primary source documents.

---

## The Core Vision

1. **Source Verification** — Every factual claim links to a primary source document. Readers don't trust us; they verify for themselves.

2. **Progressive Disclosure** — Users discover the network through exploration, not information overload. They build their own mental map.

3. **Legal Protection** — All editorial content follows First Amendment protections under Milkovich v. Lorain Journal. Documented facts separated from editorial analysis.

4. **Equal Treatment** — No entity receives special visual treatment. The data speaks for itself.

5. **Decentralized Intelligence** — We're one node. Others can verify, build upon, and extend the work.
