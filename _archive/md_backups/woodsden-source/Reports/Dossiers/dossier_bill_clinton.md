## Executive Summary

William Jefferson Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, is referenced in court documents from *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, No. 15-cv-07433-LAP (S.D.N.Y.). Virginia Giuffre made public claims about Clinton traveling to Jeffrey Epstein's private island. Maxwell's defense submitted a report from former FBI Director Louis Freeh concluding Clinton was not present on the island during the relevant time period. No allegations of sexual misconduct by Clinton appear in the analyzed court filings.

## Allegations Made by Virginia Giuffre

**IMPORTANT: The following are allegations made by Virginia Giuffre in media interviews and her unpublished manuscript. They are disputed and were characterized by Maxwell's defense as false.**

### Daily Mail Article (March 5, 2011)

According to ECF Doc. 1320-28, filed 01/03/24, pp. 7-8, Maxwell's defense quoted from Sharon Churcher's article "Teenage girl recruited by peadophile Jeffrey Epstein reveals how she twice met Bill Clinton," *Daily Mail* (Mar. 5, 2011):

> "On one occasion, she adds, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to dinner which he gave on his Caribbean island for Mr. Clinton shortly after he left office. But as far as she knows, the ex-President did not take the bait. 'I'd have been about 17 at the time,' she says. 'I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey bought her...'"
>
> "'We all dined together that night. Jeffrey was at the head of the table. Bill was at his left. I sat across from him... I only met Bill twice but Jeffrey told me they were good friends.'"

### Giuffre's Unpublished Manuscript

According to the same filing (ECF Doc. 1320-28, p. 8), Maxwell's defense quoted from Giuffre's unpublished manuscript *The Billionaire Playboys' Club*:

> "The next big dinner party on the island had another significant guest appearance being the one and only, Bill Clinton... This wasn't a big party as such, only a few of us eating at the diner table. There was Jeffrey at the head of it all, as always. On the left side was Emmy, Ghislaine and I sitting across the table from us was Bill with two lovely girls who were visiting from New York..."

## Rebuttal Evidence Submitted by Maxwell's Defense

### Louis Freeh Report

According to ECF Doc. 1320-28, filed 01/03/24, p. 8:

> "Former FBI Director Louis Freeh submitted a report wherein he concluded that President Clinton 'did not, in fact travel to, nor was he present on, Little St. James Island between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2003.' Further, if any Secret Service agents had accompanied Clinton to that location, 'they would have been required to make and file shift logs, travel vouchers, and related documentation relating to the visit,' and there was a 'total absence' of any such documentation."

### Maxwell's Defense Position

According to ECF Doc. 1320-28, filed 01/03/24, pp. 6, 9:

> "Plaintiff admits she has 'made no allegations of illegal actions by Bill Clinton.'"
>
> "Each and every part of Plaintiff's claims regarding President Clinton has conclusively been proven false."
>
> "The only purpose for seeking this deposition is for the calculated media strategy that Plaintiff and her publicity-seeking attorneys have devised."

## Travel Documentation

### Africa Trip Reference

According to deposition testimony (ECF Doc. 1331-18, p. 43), a witness recalled conversations about Clinton traveling to Africa with Kevin Spacey on a trip associated with Epstein. This appears to reference charitable work, not the Caribbean island allegations.

### Epstein's Legal Team

According to ECF Doc. 1325-2, filed 01/04/24, p. 68, an email exhibit references Epstein's legal defense team:

> "He got off the first time round after retaining Kenneth Starr (who witchhunted Bill Clinton) and Alan Dershowitz"
