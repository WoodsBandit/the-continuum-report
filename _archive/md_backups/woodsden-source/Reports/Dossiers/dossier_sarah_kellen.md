## Executive Summary

Sarah Kellen (also known as Sarah Kensington) is identified in court documents as Jeffrey Epstein's 
long-time assistant and scheduler. According to filings in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* (Case No. 15-cv-07433, 
S.D.N.Y.), Kellen was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in Epstein's 2008 federal non-prosecution 
agreement in Florida. Multiple alleged victims provided testimony describing Kellen's alleged role in 
scheduling appointments and coordinating logistics for Epstein. When deposed in civil litigation, 
Kellen reportedly invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on numerous occasions.

allegedly included:

- Coordinating travel arrangements
- Interfacing with individuals visiting Epstein's properties

In Maxwell's deposition transcript (ECF Doc. 1327-21, filed 01/05/24), when questioned about Sarah 
Kellen's activities, Maxwell testified: "I have no idea what Sarah Kellen did" and "I have no idea" 
when asked if she observed Kellen with girls under 18 at Epstein's home (p. 57, lines 4-11).

### Contact with Alleged Victims

Testimony from alleged victims, as reported in court filings, describes interactions with Sarah 
Kellen in her capacity as Epstein's assistant. These allegations, which are unproven in court, 
include claims that Kellen:

- Scheduled appointments for young women to meet with Epstein
- Coordinated travel arrangements for individuals
- Made phone calls to arrange meetings
- Was present at various Epstein properties

*Note: These are allegations from legal filings and victim testimony. Kellen has not been charged

## Civil Depositions and Fifth Amendment Invocations

### 2010 Deposition

According to references in deposition transcripts, Sarah Kellen was deposed on March 24, 2010, 
in connection with civil litigation related to Jeffrey Epstein. Court filings indicate that during 
this videotaped deposition, Kellen invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination 
in response to questioning.

In Janusz Banasiak's deposition (ECF Doc. 1327-25, filed 01/05/24), a Palm Beach County case 
styled "L.M. v. Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen" (Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB) is referenced, 
indicating Kellen was named as a defendant alongside Epstein in at least one civil action.

### 2016-2017 Giuffre v. Maxwell Litigation

Court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation include references to attempts to obtain 
testimony and documents from Kellen. However, the specific details of her testimony or document 
production in this case are not fully available in the unsealed portions of the record.

- Substance of her Fifth Amendment invocations in civil depositions

## Analysis

The documentary record establishes Sarah Kellen as a significant figure within Jeffrey Epstein's 
organizational structure during the relevant time period. Her identification as an unindicted 
co-conspirator in the 2008 federal non-prosecution agreement, combined with her naming as a defendant 
in multiple civil actions, indicates that alleged victims and prosecutors viewed her role as material 
to their cases.

However, several factors limit our understanding:

1. **Fifth Amendment Privileges**: Kellen's reported invocation of Fifth Amendment privileges in 
civil depositions means her own testimony and account remain absent from the public record.

2. **No Criminal Charges**: Despite her co-conspirator designation in the 2008 NPA, Kellen has not 
been criminally charged. The allegations against her therefore remain legally unproven.

3. **Sealed or Unavailable Records**: Many documents in the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation were filed 
under seal or subsequently unsealed in redacted form, limiting access to detailed testimony about 
Kellen's specific activities.

4. **Unknown Cooperation Status**: Whether Kellen cooperated with federal investigations under 
protections of the non-prosecution agreement, or provided information to law enforcement in any 
capacity, is not publicly known.

The pattern of litigation involvement—named as a co-conspirator in a federal matter, named as a 
defendant in multiple civil actions, and subject to discovery requests in the high-profile Giuffre v. 
Maxwell case—suggests that alleged victims and their attorneys viewed Kellen as having substantial 
knowledge of and involvement in Epstein's activities. However, the exact nature and extent of that 
alleged involvement remains largely unestablished in the public record due to the factors noted above.
