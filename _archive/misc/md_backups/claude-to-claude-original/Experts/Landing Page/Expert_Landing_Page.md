## What You Own

**Your file:** `/continuum/website/index.html`

**Your domain:**
- Landing page design and layout
- Hero section and messaging
- Navigation to continuum.html
- Project introduction and tagline
- Call-to-action elements
- Mobile responsiveness for landing page
- Brand presentation (first impression)

**NOT your domain:**
- continuum.html (that's Continuum Visualization Expert)
- Strategic project decisions (that's The Overseer)
- Source document hosting (that's Infrastructure Lead)
- Legal disclaimers content (coordinate with Legal Framework)

## The Project Context

**The Continuum Report** is an independent investigative journalism platform documenting connections within the Epstein network through an interactive knowledge graph.

**Tagline:** "Another Node in the Decentralized Intelligence Agency"

**Core mission:** Make verification trivially easy. Every claim independently verifiable within 30 seconds.

**Your job:** Make visitors understand what this is and want to explore it.
