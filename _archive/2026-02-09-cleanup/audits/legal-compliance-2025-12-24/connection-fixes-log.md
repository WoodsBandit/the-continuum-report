## Methodology

Each Alternative Interpretations section was crafted to:

1. Be case-specific and substantive (not generic boilerplate)
2. Present genuine alternative readings of the documentary evidence
3. Reflect different reasonable perspectives observers might take
4. Maintain editorial balance and journalistic integrity
5. Follow the structural template of the gold standard file
6. Include the standard closing: "We present our editorial interpretation above while acknowledging these alternatives deserve equal consideration."

---

## Quality Assurance Notes

- All alternative interpretations are grounded in the specific facts and context of each entity
- Alternatives reflect actual defenses, explanations, and contextual factors from court records and public statements
- No alternatives are purely speculative or conspiratorial
- Each section maintains the First Amendment-protected editorial commentary framework
- Placement is consistent: immediately before the Document Index section

## Sample Alternative Interpretation (Bill Clinton)

From `bill-clinton_connections.md`:

> **Flight Log Context:** While Clinton appears in flight logs for Epstein's aircraft, the documented trips were reportedly related to Clinton Foundation humanitarian work in Africa. The presence in logs does not establish knowledge of or participation in alleged crimes.

This exemplifies the standard: specific to the individual, grounded in documented explanations, and presenting a reasonable alternative reading of the evidence.
