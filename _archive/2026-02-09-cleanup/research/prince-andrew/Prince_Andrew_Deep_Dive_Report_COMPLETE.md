## ABSTRACT

This comprehensive report provides an exhaustive analysis of Prince Andrew, Duke of York's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal as documented in the January 2024 unsealing of court documents from Giuffre v. Maxwell (Case 15-cv-7433-LAP). Prince Andrew emerges as the most frequently mentioned individual aside from Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell themselves, appearing in over 70+ direct references across depositions, exhibits, and legal filings.

### Key Findings Summary

**Primary Allegation Context:**
Virginia Giuffre alleges three specific sexual encounters with Prince Andrew between 2001-2002, occurring in London (Ghislaine Maxwell's residence), New York (Epstein's Manhattan mansion), and Little St. James Island (U.S. Virgin Islands). Giuffre claims she was 17 years old at the time of the first encounter and was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell specifically to provide sexual services to the Duke of York.

**Documentary Evidence Base:**
- **Photographic Evidence:** [Famous photograph](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50449339) showing Prince Andrew with his arm around Giuffre's waist, Ghislaine Maxwell visible in background, taken at Maxwell's London townhouse
- **Flight Logs:** Multiple entries documenting Prince Andrew as passenger on Epstein's private aircraft ("Lolita Express")
- **Witness Testimony:** Corroborating statements from Johanna Sjoberg and household staff placing Andrew at Epstein properties
- **Deposition Transcripts:** Detailed testimony from Giuffre, Maxwell, and other witnesses

**Legal Outcome:**
February 2022 civil settlement estimated at $12-15 million with no admission of wrongdoing. Settlement prevented Prince Andrew from testifying under oath and ended discovery process that would have produced additional evidence and witness testimony.

**Royal Consequences:**
- Stripped of military titles and royal patronages (January 2022)
- Ceased use of HRH (His Royal Highness) in official capacity
- Withdrew from all public royal duties
- Maintains Duke of York title (can only be removed by Act of Parliament)

**Current Status:**
No criminal charges filed in any jurisdiction. FBI has not formally interviewed Prince Andrew despite multiple requests from U.S. prosecutors. UK Metropolitan Police declined to open investigation after reviewing allegations multiple times.

### Report Structure & Navigation

- Known haunt of celebrities and royals
- Would have had security/CCTV (now destroyed/unavailable)

#### 5.1.4 Prince Andrew's Counter-Narrative

**The Pizza Express Defense:**

In his [November 2019 BBC interview](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000kynm), Prince Andrew claimed:

1. **Specific Alibi:**
   - He was at Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey on March 10, 2001
   - Taking daughter Beatrice to a birthday party
   - Called it a "peculiar" but "memorable" day
   - Remembers it specifically because "you don't go to Pizza Express in Woking very often"

2. **Medical Defense:**
   - Claimed he had a medical condition that prevented him from sweating
   - Said condition resulted from "overdose of adrenalin" during Falklands War
   - Directly contradicted Giuffre's description of him "sweating profusely"
   - No medical documentation provided

3. **Photograph Skepticism:**
   - Questioned whether photo was genuine
   - Said his fingers looked unusual
   - Suggested it might be doctored
   - Claimed no memory of photo being taken
   - Said he doesn't recall ever meeting Virginia Giuffre

**Quote from BBC Interview:**
*"I don't know where that could have been taken. I've tried to work that out... That's me but I don't know whether that's my hand..."*

#### 5.1.5 Alibi Verification Attempts

**Pizza Express Woking:**
- [Specific location](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50449339): High Street, Woking, Surrey
- Restaurant still operates (became "pilgrimage site" after interview)
- No CCTV from 2001 available

- No independent verification of Andrew's presence

**Beatrice's Birthday Party:**
- Princess Beatrice would have been ~12 years old in March 2001
- No photos from party released
- No other attendees have come forward
- Andrew's office never provided supporting evidence

**Timeline Problems:**
- Flight from London to Woking: ~45 minutes
- Tramp nightclub: Evening venue (opens after 9pm)
- Giuffre's account: Late evening/night
- Andrew could theoretically have been at both locations if party was afternoon

### 5.2 New York Encounter (2001)

- Claims she was instructed to have sex with Prince Andrew
- States it was not the only time Andrew visited the property
- Less specific on exact date

**Why Less Detail:**

- New York was more routine environment for her
