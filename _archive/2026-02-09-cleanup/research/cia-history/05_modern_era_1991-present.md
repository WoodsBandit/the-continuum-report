**Author:** David Barron (Acting Chief, OLC)
**Length:** 41 pages (classified)
**Release:** June 23, 2014 (heavily redacted)

**Legal Challenge:**
- ACLU and New York Times FOIA lawsuit
- U.S. Court of Appeals (2nd Circuit) ordered release
- Significant capitulation by Obama administration after years of secrecy

### The Anwar al-Awlaki Case

**Target:** Anwar al-Awlaki
- American-born cleric
- High-ranking operational leader in Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)

- Samir Khan (U.S. citizen, AQAP propaganda editor) killed in same strike
- October 14, 2011: Abdulrahman al-Awlaki (16-year-old son, U.S. citizen) killed in separate strike

**Legal Arguments in OLC Memo:**

1. **Fifth Amendment Due Process:**
   - No person deprived of life without due process
   - Due process satisfied if target poses "imminent threat of violent attack"
   - Capture must be "infeasible"

2. **Three Elements for Internal Review:**
   - Target is senior operational leader
   - Capture is impractical
   - Lethal action consistent with laws of war

3. **Public Authority Justification (PAJ):**
   - Government representatives can perform actions banned for ordinary citizens
   - Applies to military action (less clear for CIA)

**Legal Criticism:**
- Professor Kevin Jon Heller: CIA authority on "shakier ground" than military
- Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and memo citations suggest PAJ limited to regular armed forces
- International law concerns about CIA extrajudicial killings

5. **Mass Surveillance Programs**
   - Cold War: SHAMROCK, MINARET, domestic spying on activists
   - Modern Era: Stellar Wind, PRISM, bulk metadata collection
   - **Continuity:** Warrantless surveillance justified by national security

6. **Targeted Assassination Programs**
   - Cold War: Operation Phoenix (Vietnam), plots against Castro and Lumumba
   - Modern Era: Drone strikes, targeted killing of U.S. citizens (Awlaki)
   - **Continuity:** Extrajudicial killings, expansion of executive power

7. **Legal Memos Providing Cover**
   - Cold War: OLC opinions on domestic operations, classification hiding activities
   - Modern Era: Torture memos (Yoo/Bybee), drone strike memos (Barron)
   - **Continuity:** Legal sophistry to authorize questionable activities

8. **Lack of Congressional Oversight**
   - Cold War: Limited briefings, compartmentalization, lying to Congress
   - Modern Era: Gang of Eight briefings, CIA lying to Congress (per Senate report)
   - **Continuity:** Executive branch circumventing legislative oversight

9. **Destruction of Evidence**
   - Cold War: MKUltra files destroyed (Richard Helms)
   - Modern Era: 92 torture videotapes destroyed (Rodriguez/Haspel)
   - **Continuity:** Systematic elimination of incriminating records

10. **Whistleblower Retaliation**
    - Cold War: Prosecutions, career destruction, surveillance of critics
    - Modern Era: Edward Snowden exile, Chelsea Manning imprisonment, prosecution of sources
    - **Continuity:** Aggressive response to exposure of illegal programs

### Institutional Patterns

**Cycle of Reform and Regression:**
- Post-Church Committee: Oversight reforms, CIA restrictions
- Post-9/11: Restrictions loosened, torture authorized, surveillance expanded
- Pattern: Temporary reforms followed by expansion when threat perceived

**State Secrets Doctrine:**
- Consistently used to block judicial review
- El-Masri case, Abu Zubaydah case, NSA lawsuits
- Prevents accountability through courts

**Parallel Construction:**
- Using classified intelligence while hiding sources
- NSA feeds to DEA, IRS ("Special Operations Division")
- Continuity with Cold War domestic intelligence sharing

## Research Notes

### Heavily Redacted / Unreleased Documents
- Full Senate Torture Report (6,700 pages) - CLASSIFIED, never released
- 7+ additional OLC memos on targeted killing - CLASSIFIED
- Many CIA cables and operational documents - Heavily redacted or unreleased
- NSA documents - Vast majority remain classified

### Legal Barriers to Document Access
- **State Secrets Doctrine:** Used to block court cases and discovery
- **Congressional vs. Agency Records:** Senate report ruled not subject to FOIA
- **Ongoing Classification:** Many documents decades old remain classified
- **Destroyed Evidence:** 92 torture videotapes, MKUltra files - permanently lost

### Key Whistleblowers & Sources
- **Coleen Rowley** - FBI pre-9/11 failures
- **Thomas Tamm** - Stellar Wind to NYT
- **Edward Snowden** - NSA mass surveillance (in exile)
- **Chelsea Manning** - Iraq/Afghanistan war logs (imprisoned, later pardoned)
- **Daniel Hale** - Drone program (imprisoned)
- **John Kiriakou** - First CIA official to confirm waterboarding (imprisoned)

### Continuities from Cold War
The Modern Era demonstrates that the institutional patterns established during the Cold War were not aberrations but **operational defaults** that re-emerge when oversight weakens:
- Torture programs mirror Phoenix and KUBARK
- Black sites echo Latin American disappearances
- Mass surveillance continues SHAMROCK/MINARET
- Targeted killing expands Phoenix assassination program
- Legal memos provide cover like in Cold War
- Evidence destruction repeats (Helms → Rodriguez/Haspel)

**Key Difference:** Digital age creates massive documentary evidence (emails, cables, databases) that is harder to completely destroy, leading to larger-scale leaks (Snowden, torture files) than possible in Cold War era.
