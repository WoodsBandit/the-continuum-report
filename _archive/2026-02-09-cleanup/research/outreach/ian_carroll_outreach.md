### Email Body

Ian,

Full disclosure up front: this email was drafted by Claude at my request. You're actually the one who turned me onto using it for research in the first place—I saw your post about building base layer instructions for sourcing and bias detection. That approach changed how I work. So thanks for that.

I'm reaching out because I've been building something called **The Continuum Report** ([thecontinuumreport.com](https://thecontinuumreport.com)) and I think there's potential for collaboration, or at minimum I'd value your perspective on the direction.

#### What It Is

The Continuum Report is an open-source intelligence research project with a document processing pipeline that ingests primary sources—court filings, FOIA releases, SEC documents, leaked materials—and maps the documented connections between power structures. Not speculation. Not inference. Documented, cited, verifiable connections.

The output is what I'm calling "Analytical Briefs"—structured intelligence products with full citation chains back to primary sources. Think of it as an Obsidian-style knowledge graph specifically built for mapping elite networks, but with the legal framework of protected journalistic activity under the First Amendment.

#### Why It's Different

Most research in this space lives and dies in Twitter threads, YouTube videos, or books that people reference but rarely verify. The sourcing gets lost. The connections become folklore instead of documented fact.

The Continuum Report is **infrastructure**. The goal is to create a persistent, searchable, citation-verified map of connections that researchers can build on rather than constantly recreating. When someone makes a claim about Epstein's intelligence connections or BlackRock's board interlocks, there should be a place where the primary source documentation either exists or demonstrably doesn't.

I've already processed significant portions of Whitney Webb's *One Nation Under Blackmail* citation structure and the Epstein court document releases, mapping the connections with source verification.

#### Why I'm Reaching Out to You Specifically

You've built tools that serve similar ends—your Webb tool, your 3-hour livestreams deep-diving into primary sources. But that's actually part of the problem this project is trying to solve: incredible research gets buried in long-form video that's nearly impossible to search, cite, or build on. Someone wants to verify a connection you covered in hour two of a Friday stream from six months ago? Good luck finding it.

I'm not trying to compete with what you're doing. I'm thinking about how these projects could be nodes in a larger **Decentralized Intelligence Network**—independent researchers building interoperable infrastructure that's harder to suppress, censor, or discredit than any single source.

If The Continuum Report's analytical briefs could feed into or cross-reference your tools, or vice versa, we're building something more resilient than either project alone. Decentralized research infrastructure with verified sourcing is the antidote to both mainstream narrative control and the "conspiracy theory" dismissal trap.

---

#### The Ask

I'm open to whatever makes sense:

- Direct collaboration or data sharing  
- Integration between our tools/platforms  
- Just a conversation where you tell me what I'm doing wrong or what gaps you see  

I'm not looking for promotion or clout. I'm looking to build something that actually moves the needle on accessible, verified, primary-source intelligence research.

If any of this resonates, I'm easy to reach. If not, no hard feelings—keep doing what you're doing.
