### Source: Settlement of *Giuffre v. Andrew* (February 2022)

The civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre against Prince Andrew in the Southern District of New York was settled in February 2022. The settlement included:
- An undisclosed financial payment
- A statement that Andrew "never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character"
- A donation by Andrew to Giuffre's charity supporting victims' rights
- No admission of liability or wrongdoing

Prince Andrew issued a statement acknowledging "that Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years" and commending "the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, the documented record presents a significant accusation by Virginia Giuffre against Prince Andrew that was never adjudicated on its merits. The case settled before any discovery or trial could test the allegations.

The photograph showing Giuffre with Prince Andrew at Maxwell's London residence appears to establish, at minimum, that the two were in proximity during the period in question. Maxwell's deposition testimony — claiming no recollection of Giuffre's presence at her home with Prince Andrew despite this photographic evidence — seems difficult to reconcile with the documentary record.

We interpret Giuffre's sworn allegations as specific and detailed: three alleged encounters in London when she was 17 years old, with payment of $15,000 after the first instance. These allegations were made under oath and under penalty of perjury.

The settlement of the civil case, in our view, forecloses definitive conclusions. Andrew made no admission of wrongdoing, and Giuffre's allegations were never tested through discovery, cross-examination, or trial. The settlement terms — including Andrew's acknowledgment of Epstein's trafficking and praise for Giuffre's "bravery" — are susceptible to multiple interpretations.

We note that Prince Andrew has never been charged with any criminal offense related to these allegations, and he has consistently denied wrongdoing.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **Categorical Denial:** Prince Andrew categorically denied Giuffre's allegations in a November 2019 BBC interview and maintained this denial throughout the civil litigation. Some observers may credit these denials, noting that the allegations were never proven in court.

2. **Settlement Interpretation:** Settlements are common in civil litigation and do not constitute admissions of liability. Andrew may have settled to avoid prolonged negative publicity and the personal toll of litigation, regardless of the merits of the defense.

3. **Photograph Limitations:** The photograph establishes only that Andrew and Giuffre were at the same location on at least one occasion. It does not establish the nature of any relationship or corroborate allegations of sexual contact.

4. **No Criminal Charges:** Despite years of investigation and public allegations, no criminal charges have been brought against Prince Andrew in any jurisdiction. Some interpret this as indicating insufficient evidence to meet criminal standards.

5. **Timing Questions:** Defense counsel raised questions about the consistency of Giuffre's accounts over time. Discrepancies in memory or narrative across multiple statements are common and can be interpreted as either evidence of fabrication or normal memory variation.

6. **Financial Motivation:** Some observers note that civil litigation against wealthy defendants creates financial incentives that may influence accusations. This interpretation does not disprove allegations but suggests caution in evaluation.
