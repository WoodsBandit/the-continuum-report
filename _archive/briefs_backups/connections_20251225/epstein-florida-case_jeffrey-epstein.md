### Source: ECF 1325-3 — Jane Doe #3 and #4 Motion for Joinder

Regarding Jane Doe #4:

> "an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-old child" who was told "she could make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach" in or around summer 2002. The motion alleged Epstein himself got on the phone with Jane Doe #4, "asking her personally to come to his mansion in Palm Beach." During her first visit, "Epstein asked Jane Doe #[4] her age and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed illegal sexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions."

### Source: ECF 1331-4 — Evidence Spoliation Reference

> When Palm Beach Police executed a search warrant on Epstein's mansion, they found that computers had been removed from their places, "leaving the monitors, mice, keyboards, and wires behind."

### The Non-Prosecution Agreement — Key Terms

According to court filings, the 2008 NPA:
1. Was kept secret from victims until after it was finalized
2. Protected Epstein from federal prosecution
3. Protected unnamed "co-conspirators" from federal prosecution
4. Resulted in state charges only — Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution
5. Allowed work release during his 13-month county jail sentence

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The Epstein Florida Case represents the first major attempt to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein for sex trafficking crimes. In our assessment, this connection is foundational because it establishes Epstein as the central subject of federal investigation and the primary defendant in the controversial 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement.

**Regarding the NPA:** The agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office appears to have been extraordinarily favorable to Epstein. State charges for solicitation of prostitution with minimal jail time contrast sharply with the federal sex trafficking charges that evidence suggested could have been pursued.

**Regarding victim impact:** The Crime Victims' Rights Act litigation filed by Jane Doe #1 and #2 established that victims' rights were violated when the NPA was negotiated in secret. This precedent-setting case demonstrated Epstein's ability to secure favorable treatment even as evidence accumulated against him.

**Regarding the evidence spoliation:** Testimony about computer removal before the search warrant execution raises questions about potential obstruction. Epstein's resources appear to have enabled sophisticated legal and practical responses to investigation.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Epstein Florida Case represents both Epstein's first major legal accountability and a failure of the justice system. The NPA allowed him to avoid federal prosecution for over a decade until his 2019 arrest.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Prosecutorial discretion:** The NPA may have reflected legitimate assessments of trial risks, evidence quality, or victim cooperation that are not visible in the public record.

2. **Legal complexity:** Sex trafficking cases in 2008 may have faced evidentiary challenges that informed prosecutorial decisions.

3. **Resource constraints:** Federal prosecutors may have faced legitimate resource allocation decisions.

4. **Victim considerations:** Avoiding trial may have been preferred by some victims to spare them from public testimony.

5. **Subsequent correction:** The 2019 federal prosecution demonstrated the system's eventual willingness to revisit the case, though Epstein's death prevented adjudication.
