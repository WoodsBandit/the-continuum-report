**[ECF Doc. 1320-28](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-28.pdf), filed 01/03/24, pp. 7-8** (quoting Sharon Churcher's article "Teenage girl recruited by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein reveals how she twice met Bill Clinton," *Daily Mail*, Mar. 5, 2011):

> "On one occasion, she adds, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to dinner which he gave on his Caribbean island for Mr. Clinton shortly after he left office. But as far as she knows, the ex-President did not take the bait. 'I'd have been about 17 at the time,' she says. 'I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey bought her...'"
>
> "'We all dined together that night. Jeffrey was at the head of the table. Bill was at his left. I sat across from him... I only met Bill twice but Jeffrey told me they were good friends.'"

> "The next big dinner party on the island had another significant guest appearance being the one and only, Bill Clinton... This wasn't a big party as such, only a few of us eating at the diner table. There was Jeffrey at the head of it all, as always. On the left side was Emmy, Ghislaine and I sitting across the table from us was Bill with two lovely girls who were visiting from New York..."

> "Former FBI Director Louis Freeh submitted a report wherein he concluded that President Clinton 'did not, in fact travel to, nor was he present on, Little St. James Island between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2003.' Further, if any Secret Service agents had accompanied Clinton to that location, 'they would have been required to make and file shift logs, travel vouchers, and related documentation relating to the visit,' and there was a 'total absence' of any such documentation."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, the documentary record regarding the Bill Clinton-Virginia Giuffre connection presents a notably unusual situation: a connection that exists primarily through Giuffre's media statements and manuscript, which were then vigorously rebutted in court filings.

**Regarding Giuffre's claims:** Giuffre described attending a dinner with Clinton on Epstein's island in media interviews and her unpublished manuscript. These accounts were not made under oath in deposition testimony and were characterized by Maxwell's defense as false.

**Regarding the rebuttal:** The Louis Freeh report—submitted by Maxwell's defense—represents significant exculpatory evidence. A former FBI Director's investigation finding Clinton was not present on the island during the relevant period, supported by the absence of Secret Service documentation, appears to directly contradict Giuffre's account.

**Regarding Giuffre's own acknowledgment:** We find it particularly significant that Giuffre herself admitted making "no allegations of illegal actions by Bill Clinton." This acknowledgment, quoted in court filings, establishes that whatever connection existed in her account was contextual rather than accusatory.

**Regarding the nature of this connection:** Unlike other connections documented in this project, the Clinton-Giuffre connection appears to be one where the accuser herself disclaimed any allegation of wrongdoing, and where rebuttal evidence challenged the factual basis of her descriptive claims.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **The Freeh report may be dispositive.** A former FBI Director's investigation finding no evidence Clinton visited the island, combined with absent Secret Service records, may fully resolve the factual question of whether the dinner Giuffre described occurred.

2. **Giuffre's media statements may reflect memory issues or other factors** rather than deliberate falsehood. Memory of events from years prior can be unreliable, and Maxwell's characterization of them as "proven false" is an adversarial litigation position, not a judicial finding.

3. **The Africa trip reference** in deposition testimony describes charitable work unrelated to Epstein's Caribbean properties and does not establish any improper conduct.

4. **Clinton's social connection to Epstein**, documented in flight logs and other public reporting outside this document set, does not establish knowledge of or participation in illegal activity.

5. **Questions asked of other witnesses** about Clinton (such as Marcinkova's deposition) were attorney questions, not evidence. The framing of questions does not establish that the conduct implied actually occurred.

6. **The absence of any allegations** against Clinton in the actual litigation underscores that his name appears in the record contextually, not as an accused party.

## Methodology Note

This connection brief was generated by analyzing court filings from *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, Case No. 15-cv-07433 (S.D.N.Y.). Direct quotes are extracted verbatim from unsealed documents released January 2024. Editorial analysis sections represent protected opinion under First Amendment precedent established in *Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1 (1990).

**Critical Note:** Bill Clinton was not a party to this litigation. He has never been charged with any crime related to Jeffrey Epstein. Virginia Giuffre explicitly disclaimed any allegations of illegal conduct against him. This connection brief documents references in the litigation record, not allegations of wrongdoing.
