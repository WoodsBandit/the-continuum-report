## The Public Record

### Financial Management Relationship

**Per public reporting and Wexner's 2019 statement:**

Les Wexner engaged Jeffrey Epstein as his personal financial manager beginning in the late 1980s. This relationship included:

- Management of Wexner's personal and business finances
- Power of attorney granted to Epstein over Wexner's affairs
- Access to Wexner's financial accounts and assets
- Duration of approximately 20 years

**Wexner 2019 Statement (L Brands press release, August 2019):**

> "I would never have guessed that a person I employed more than a decade ago could have caused such pain to so many people."

Wexner stated he severed the relationship in 2007 after the Florida investigation became public.

### Manhattan Townhouse Transfer

**Property:** 9 East 71st Street, Manhattan, New York

The Manhattan townhouse, one of the largest private residences in New York City, was transferred from Wexner to Epstein. The circumstances of this transfer have been characterized differently over time:

**New York Times (2019) Reporting:**
The property was reportedly purchased by Wexner in 1989 for approximately $13 million and underwent extensive renovation. Epstein later claimed ownership. Wexner's representatives have stated Epstein "misappropriated" assets including this property.

**Transfer Documentation:**
Property records indicate the transfer occurred, but the consideration paid (if any) and the terms remain subjects of public reporting discrepancies.

### Power of Attorney

Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs. This is an unusually expansive grant of authority that would allow Epstein to:

- Execute financial transactions on Wexner's behalf
- Access and manage accounts
- Make binding decisions regarding assets

Wexner has stated this power of attorney was revoked when he severed ties in 2007.

### "Misappropriation" Allegation

**Wexner Office Statement (2019):**

Wexner's office stated that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money" from Wexner. This characterization positions Wexner as a victim of Epstein's financial misconduct.

**Notable Gap:**
No public legal action by Wexner against Epstein's estate for misappropriation has been documented.

### FBI Co-Conspirator Identification (July 2019)

**Source:** FBI New York internal email (House Oversight Committee disclosure)

FBI identified Wexner as one of "10 co-conspirators" in the Epstein investigation, describing him as a "wealthy business man in Ohio." No subpoena was issued to Wexner at the time of the email. No charges were filed. Wexner's attorney later claimed he was "cleared," though no FBI or DOJ documentation of this clearing exists in the public record.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

### The Central Question

In our assessment, the Wexner-Epstein relationship represents one of the most unusual financial arrangements in modern business history. A sophisticated billionaire businessman granted sweeping financial control to an individual with limited documented financial credentials.

**Questions that remain unanswered:**

1. **Due Diligence** — What due diligence did Wexner conduct before granting power of attorney to Epstein?

2. **Property Transfer** — What were the actual terms of the townhouse transfer? Was consideration paid?

3. **Misappropriation Timeline** — When did Wexner discover the alleged misappropriation? Why was no legal action taken?

4. **Knowledge of Conduct** — What did Wexner know about Epstein's personal life during 20 years of close financial relationship?

5. **FBI Designation** — What evidence supported FBI's co-conspirator identification, and why was Wexner not prosecuted?

### Pattern Analysis

The documented relationship shows:

- **Unusual Access** — Epstein had extraordinary access to Wexner's finances via power of attorney
- **Property Transfer** — Valuable Manhattan property transferred under disputed circumstances
- **Long Duration** — Relationship lasted approximately 20 years
- **Severance Timing** — Relationship ended when investigation became public (2007)
- **Victim Positioning** — Wexner characterized as victim of misappropriation (2019)

We note that Wexner has never been charged with any crime and denies knowledge of Epstein's conduct.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same records might reasonably conclude:

- **Pure Victim Interpretation** — Wexner was entirely deceived by Epstein, who was a skilled financial con artist. Sophisticated businesspeople can be defrauded. The misappropriation claim supports this view.

- **Arm's Length Interpretation** — The financial relationship was purely professional. Wexner interacted with Epstein only in formal business settings and had no exposure to his personal life or criminal conduct.

- **Willful Blindness Interpretation** — Wexner may have avoided asking questions about Epstein's lifestyle or income sources. This does not require knowledge of specific crimes but suggests less-than-complete oversight.

- **Geographic Distance Interpretation** — Wexner was based in Ohio while Epstein operated primarily in New York, Florida, and the Virgin Islands. Physical distance may have limited Wexner's visibility into Epstein's activities.

- **Prosecutorial Assessment Interpretation** — The FBI identified Wexner as a co-conspirator but DOJ did not prosecute. This may reflect insufficient evidence, prosecutorial discretion, or determination that Wexner was not culpable despite the designation.

Each interpretation has supporting evidence and reasonable adherents.
