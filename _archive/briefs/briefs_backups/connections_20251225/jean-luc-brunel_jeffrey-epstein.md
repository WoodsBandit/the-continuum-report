### Source: ECF 1325-3 — Court Characterization of Relationship

> "Another person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc Brunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein's closest friends and a regular traveling companion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. visas for many girls."

### Flight Logs

Epstein flight logs document Jean-Luc Brunel as a frequent passenger on Epstein's aircraft between the 1990s and 2000s.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The Brunel-Epstein connection represents one of the most extensively documented relationships in the Epstein network:

**Court characterization:** Plaintiff's filings explicitly characterized Brunel as part of Epstein's "inner circle" and alleged trafficking of victims to Brunel "many times." These are allegations from court filings, not adjudicated facts.

**Business nexus:** Epstein's funding of Brunel's modeling agency creates a documented financial relationship that also provided structural access to young women in the modeling industry.

**Travel companion:** Flight logs establish Brunel as a frequent travel companion on Epstein's aircraft, corroborating the "regular traveling companion" characterization in court filings.

**Both deceased before adjudication:** Neither Epstein nor Brunel lived to see their respective criminal cases adjudicated. Brunel was arrested in France in December 2020 and died in custody in February 2022.

In our assessment, the documentary evidence establishes a close, multi-faceted relationship between Brunel and Epstein encompassing business, travel, and social dimensions, with serious allegations that were never tested at trial due to both men's deaths.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Allegations not adjudicated:** Brunel died before trial and was never convicted. The presumption of innocence applies.

2. **Plaintiff characterizations:** The "inner circle" and trafficking language comes from plaintiff's filings presenting one side's view.

3. **Fifth Amendment protection:** Witnesses invoked Fifth Amendment for many reasons; invocations do not establish facts about Brunel or Epstein.

4. **Business relationship context:** Brunel may have had legitimate modeling industry connections with Epstein separate from any criminal activity.

5. **Death prevented defense:** Brunel was unable to present a defense before his death in custody.
