*Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Prince Andrew as Discovery Target

**[ECF Doc. 1327-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-12.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24:

> "sought, inter alia: all communications with thirteen specific witnesses, namely Jeffrey Epstein, Virginia Roberts, Prince Andrew, Ross Gow, Alan Dershowitz, Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Glenn and Eva Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcincova and Bill and Hillary Clinton."

Prince Andrew was one of thirteen specifically named individuals for whom Giuffre requested all of Maxwell's communications.

### ECF 1327-14 — Witness Significance

**[ECF Doc. 1327-14](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-14.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24:

Maxwell's attorney Laura Menninger distinguished Prince Andrew from hundreds of other proposed witness names, confirming he was among a limited group of specific witnesses central to the litigation.

### Nature of Giuffre's Underlying Allegations

According to pleadings filed in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* and subsequent *Giuffre v. Prince Andrew*:

- Giuffre alleged she was approximately 17 years old when directed to engage in sexual acts with Prince Andrew
- The encounters allegedly occurred at multiple locations including Maxwell's London residence, Epstein's New York mansion, and Epstein's private island
- Giuffre alleged Maxwell personally orchestrated and facilitated these encounters

### The Photograph in the Record

A photograph referenced in the litigation shows Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre, with Ghislaine Maxwell visible in the background. The photograph purportedly was taken at Maxwell's London residence in 2001, when Giuffre was 17.

### Case Documents and 2024 Unsealing

The January 2024 unsealing of *Giuffre v. Maxwell* documents brought extensive materials regarding Prince Andrew into public view, including:
- Discovery requests targeting communications with Prince Andrew
- References to Prince Andrew in deposition testimony
- Documentation of his significance as a witness in the litigation

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Prince Andrew's role in the case:** In our assessment, Prince Andrew was a central figure in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* even though he was not a party. Giuffre's allegations against Maxwell included claims that Maxwell trafficked her to Prince Andrew, making Maxwell's communications with Prince Andrew directly relevant to the truth or falsity of Giuffre's allegations.

**Regarding the case's impact:** The discovery conducted in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* and the 2024 unsealing provided substantial documentation relevant to Prince Andrew's situation. This documentary record contributed to public understanding of the allegations against him.

**Regarding the separate civil suit:** Giuffre subsequently filed a separate lawsuit against Prince Andrew in August 2021, which settled in February 2022 without admission of liability. The *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case materials provided evidentiary foundation for that separate proceeding.

**Our editorial judgment:** The *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case produced a significant documentary record regarding Prince Andrew's alleged connection to Epstein's trafficking operation. The 2024 unsealing brought this record into public view, though Prince Andrew's settlement in his own case resolved his legal exposure without adjudication.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Discovery requests are not evidence.** Seeking communications about an individual does not establish the content or significance of any communications that may have existed.

2. **The case settled without adjudication.** No finder of fact determined the truth of Giuffre's allegations in this proceeding.

3. **Prince Andrew's denials are categorical.** He has consistently denied all allegations of wrongdoing.

4. **The photograph proves proximity, not conduct.** Its existence establishes that Prince Andrew met Giuffre, not that the alleged conduct occurred.

5. **Separate settlement:** Prince Andrew's own case settled for undisclosed terms without admission of liability, leaving factual questions unresolved.
