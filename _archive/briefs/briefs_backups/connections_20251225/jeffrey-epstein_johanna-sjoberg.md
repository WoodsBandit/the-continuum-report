**[ECF Doc. 1327-23](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-23.pdf)** (Deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, May 18, 2016):

Johanna Sjoberg provided deposition testimony in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case addressing:
- Circumstances of her initial contact with the Epstein operation
- Her experiences at Epstein's properties
- Observations of other individuals and activities
- The role of Ghislaine Maxwell in recruitment

### Recruitment Account

According to testimony and published accounts, Sjoberg was approached while a college student with what appeared to be a legitimate job opportunity. This recruitment method—using the appearance of legitimate employment—is consistent with accounts from other alleged victims.

### Maxwell Criminal Trial Testimony

Johanna Sjoberg testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's federal criminal trial in the Southern District of New York (December 2021). Her testimony contributed to the evidentiary record supporting Maxwell's conviction on sex trafficking charges.

### Victim Status

Sjoberg is identified in court records as an alleged victim of Epstein. Her willingness to provide testimony in both civil and criminal proceedings contributed to the documentary record and Maxwell's prosecution.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, the Epstein-Sjoberg connection represents a documented victim-perpetrator relationship corroborated by sworn testimony in multiple proceedings.

**Regarding recruitment methods:** Sjoberg's account of being recruited through an apparent legitimate job opportunity while in college illustrates a documented pattern. This method appears throughout victim accounts—using the appearance of normalcy to lower defenses.

**Regarding testimony significance:** Sjoberg provided testimony in both the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case (2016 deposition) and the Maxwell criminal trial (2021). Consistency across multiple proceedings and years strengthens the evidentiary weight of her account.

**Regarding Epstein's death:** Epstein's death in August 2019 means Sjoberg will never see him prosecuted for the abuse she alleges. However, Maxwell's conviction provides partial institutional validation.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Epstein-Sjoberg connection is well-documented through sworn testimony. Her willingness to testify publicly distinguishes her account and contributed to the only criminal conviction arising from the Epstein matter.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Epstein never adjudicated:** Epstein died before trial. While Sjoberg's testimony contributed to Maxwell's conviction, no jury ever found Epstein guilty of crimes against Sjoberg specifically.

2. **Memory and retrospection:** Testimony given years after events may be affected by time, subsequent information, or media coverage.

3. **Civil litigation context:** The 2016 deposition was given in adversarial civil litigation where testimony serves strategic purposes.

4. **Corroboration value:** While consistency with other accounts can indicate truth, it can also reflect information sharing between witnesses.

5. **Criminal trial validation:** Sjoberg's testimony was heard by the Maxwell trial jury, which found Maxwell guilty—providing institutional assessment of credibility.
