## Alternative Interpretations

The documentary evidence in this connection analysis permits multiple reasonable interpretations:

1. **Assistant Role Interpretation:** Kellen was employed as Epstein's assistant and scheduler. Her documentary connections may reflect administrative employment duties rather than knowing participation in alleged criminal conduct.

2. **Immunity Under Non-Prosecution Agreement:** Kellen received immunity under the Florida non-prosecution agreement, which suggests both potential criminal exposure and prosecutorial decision not to pursue charges. The legal and factual significance of this immunity is subject to interpretation.

3. **Victim-Turned-Employee Theory:** Some interpretations suggest Kellen may have initially been victimized by Epstein and subsequently employed by him, potentially under coercive or grooming circumstances. Different characterizations of this trajectory lead to different moral and legal conclusions.

4. **Invoking Fifth Amendment Protections:** In some depositions, Kellen invoked Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. This constitutional right does not establish guilt but does indicate legal counsel's assessment of potential jeopardy.

5. **Name Change and Privacy:** Kellen changed her name and has sought to maintain privacy about her past. This could be interpreted as evidence of guilt and evasion, or as a trauma survivor's legitimate attempt to establish a new life after exiting a harmful situation.

We present our editorial interpretation above while acknowledging these alternatives deserve equal consideration.
