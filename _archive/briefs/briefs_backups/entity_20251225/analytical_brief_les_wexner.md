## Statement of Public Interest

Les Wexner is the billionaire founder of L Brands (Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works) and was **Jeffrey Epstein's** most prominent financial client. The nature and duration of their relationship, including Wexner's granting of power of attorney to Epstein, raises questions of public interest regarding due diligence and financial oversight.

---

## Executive Summary

In our assessment, the Wexner-Epstein relationship represents one of the most unusual financial arrangements in modern business history. Wexner granted Epstein sweeping power of attorney, allowed him to live in a Manhattan mansion owned by Wexner, and entrusted him with management of his personal fortune. Wexner has stated he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after the Florida investigation became public and claims to have been unaware of Epstein's criminal conduct.

## The Public Record

### Financial Relationship

Per public reporting and SEC filings:

- Epstein began managing Wexner's finances in the late 1980s
- Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs
- The 71st Street Manhattan townhouse was transferred from Wexner to Epstein under disputed circumstances
- Wexner's office stated in 2019 that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money" from him

### Documented Connections

The following individuals connected to Wexner appear in other briefs:

- **Jeffrey Epstein** — Primary financial relationship
- **Ghislaine Maxwell** — Attended events at Wexner properties per witness testimony
- **Virginia Giuffre** — Referenced Wexner properties in deposition testimony
- **Sarah Kellen** — Worked as Epstein's assistant during period of Wexner relationship

### Severance of Relationship

Per Wexner's 2019 public statement:

> "I would never have guessed that a person I employed more than a decade ago could have caused such pain to so many people."

Wexner stated he ended the relationship in 2007.

### FBI Co-Conspirator Identification (July 2019)

**Source:** FBI New York office internal email (House Oversight Committee Congressional disclosure, December 2025)

Per the documented FBI communication:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Designation** | Co-conspirator (one of 10 identified) |
| **Description** | "Wealthy business man in Ohio" |
| **Subpoena Status** | No subpoena issued at time of email |
| **Date** | July 2019 (following Epstein arrest July 6, 2019) |

**Subsequent Developments:**

- No FBI charges filed against Wexner
- No DOJ prosecution initiated
- Wexner's attorney subsequently claimed client was "cleared"
- No FBI or DOJ documentation of "clearing" exists in public record
- No formal statement from FBI or DOJ confirming cleared status

**Documentation Gap:** The discrepancy between FBI co-conspirator identification and the attorney's "cleared" claim remains unexplained in the public record. The process by which Wexner was purportedly cleared, and the evidentiary basis for that determination, are not documented in publicly available materials.

**Connection Brief:** See `fbi_wexner_coconspirator.md` for detailed analysis.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our view, the Wexner-Epstein relationship raises significant questions that remain unanswered:

1. **Due Diligence Concerns** — We find it notable that a sophisticated businessman would grant such expansive financial control to an individual with Epstein's limited documented financial background.

2. **Property Transfer** — The circumstances under which the Manhattan townhouse transferred from Wexner to Epstein remain unclear. Wexner's representatives have characterized this differently over time.

3. **Duration of Knowledge** — While Wexner states he severed ties in 2007, the extent of his knowledge prior to that date is, in our assessment, an open question.

4. **FBI Co-Conspirator Designation** — The July 2019 FBI identification of Wexner as one of 10 co-conspirators, followed by no prosecution and an attorney claim of being "cleared" without corresponding documentation, raises questions about the evidentiary basis for both the designation and the purported clearing.

We emphasize that Wexner has never been charged with any crime, has denied knowledge of Epstein's conduct, and claims victim status regarding financial misappropriation. The FBI co-conspirator designation did not result in charges, and his attorney has stated he was cleared.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers may reach different conclusions:

- **Victim Interpretation** — Wexner was a victim of Epstein's manipulation and financial fraud, as his representatives have stated. Sophisticated individuals can be deceived by skilled con artists.

- **Willful Blindness Interpretation** — Wexner may have avoided asking questions about Epstein's conduct or income sources. This interpretation does not require knowledge of specific crimes.

- **Pure Business Interpretation** — The relationship was purely financial, Epstein performed legitimate services, and Wexner had no exposure to Epstein's criminal conduct.

- **Compartmentalization Interpretation** — Wexner may have known Epstein in only a professional capacity, with their interactions limited to financial matters. Epstein's personal life may have been entirely separate from their business relationship.

- **Limited Exposure Interpretation** — Given the geographic distance between Wexner's Ohio base and Epstein's primary residences in New York, Palm Beach, and the Virgin Islands, Wexner may have had minimal direct exposure to Epstein's activities beyond financial meetings.

- **Misappropriation Timeline Interpretation** — Wexner's 2019 statement about misappropriation suggests he discovered financial improprieties only after severing the relationship in 2007, which would be consistent with delayed discovery of fraud.

- **Co-Conspirator Designation Interpretation** — The FBI's July 2019 identification of Wexner as a co-conspirator may reflect an early investigative theory that was later abandoned based on insufficient evidence. "Co-conspirator" in an internal email does not carry the same legal weight as a formal indictment.

- **Prosecutorial Discretion Interpretation** — The decision not to prosecute Wexner may reflect standard prosecutorial discretion based on evidentiary sufficiency, resource allocation, or other legitimate factors unrelated to wealth or influence.

Each interpretation has supporting evidence and reasonable adherents.
