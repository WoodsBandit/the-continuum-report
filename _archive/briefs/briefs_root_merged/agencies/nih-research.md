## 5. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES

### Gain-of-Function Research & Wuhan Institute
- 2014 Grant: $3.4M to EcoHealth; $598,500 subaward to Wuhan Institute of Virology
- May 2024: NIH admitted U.S. taxpayers funded gain-of-function research at WIV
- Contradicted prior Fauci testimony (2021)
- WIV withheld laboratory notebooks
- August 2022: NIH terminated WIV subaward
- HHS began EcoHealth debarment proceedings

### Fauci/NIAID Controversy
- 2021: Fauci denied NIH funded gain-of-function in Wuhan
- 2024 testimony contradicted this admission
- Dr. David Morens allegedly obstructed investigations
- $710 million in pharmaceutical royalties to NIH scientists during pandemic

### 2025 Restructuring
- Proposed: 27 institutes → 8 institutes
- 4 institutes proposed for elimination (nursing, alternative medicine, minority health, global health)
- ~$2.3B frozen across 2,500 grants (November 2025)
- ~2,100 grants cut worth $9.5B (June 2025)
- Indirect cost cap proposal: 15% (from ~50% average)
- Senate Republicans pushed back on cut magnitude
