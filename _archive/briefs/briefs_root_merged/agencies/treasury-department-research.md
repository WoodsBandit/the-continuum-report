### **6. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES**

**A. IRS Targeting Scandal (2013)**

**Nature of Controversy:** The IRS selectively subjected political organizations applying for tax-exempt status to intensive scrutiny based on political names and themes rather than legitimate indicators of political activity.

**Key Findings:**
- **May 14, 2013:** Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported the IRS "used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions"
- IRS Commissioner Steven Miller was forced to resign by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew
- **Lois Lerner**, Director of Tax-Exempt Organizations, publicly broke news via planted question; invoked Fifth Amendment before Congress (May 2014); retired late 2013
- **Email destruction controversy:** IRS data center in Martinsburg, WV magnetically erased 422 backup tapes on March 4, 2014, destroying approximately 24,000 Lois Lerner emails from 2011
- **Document production failures:** Treasury Department failed to fully comply with August 2013 congressional subpoenas for Lerner communications (2009-2013) and other IRS officials' records

**Later Findings:**
- **October 2017:** Treasury Inspector General released exhaustive report finding IRS targeted both conservative ("Tea Party") AND liberal organizations ("progressive" keywords) from 2004-2013
- **October 2015:** Justice Department closed two-year criminal investigation without charging Lerner or other IRS officials
- **October 2017:** DOJ settled multiple lawsuits over the targeting scandal

**Source:** House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; Treasury Inspector General reports; CNN, NPR, and court records

**B. OFAC Sanctions Enforcement Violations & Penalties**

**Recent Enforcement Actions:**
- **December 2024:** $1,092,000 settlement with individual for 122 violations of Russia sanctions (2018-2022); individual served as fiduciary of sanctioned Russian oligarch's family trust
- **November 2024:** $4,677,552 civil penalty against individual for Russia and reporting violations
- **2024:** $1,104,408 penalty against individual for 75 Iran sanctions violations
- **2023:** OFAC sanctioned four companies operating in Venezuela's oil sector; identified four oil tankers as blocked property in shadow fleet operations

**Enforcement Framework:**
- Violations may result in civil and criminal penalties on strict liability basis
- Whistleblower incentive program: Awards available for information leading to enforcement actions exceeding $1 million in penalties
- Self-disclosure and voluntary compliance programs receive credit for cooperation

**Source:** OFAC official enforcement records and press releases (2024-2025)

**C. BCCI Scandal (1991-1993) - Historical Context**

**Background:** Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), founded 1972, became seventh-largest private bank with $20 billion assets and 400+ branches in 78 countries by early 1980s.

**Criminal Activity:** Involved in massive money laundering, illegal acquisition of controlling interest in First American Bank (U.S.)

**Treasury/Intelligence Failures:**
- CIA knew BCCI's intentions by early 1985 and informed Treasury and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—but information was not shared with Federal Reserve or Justice Department (proper regulators)
- **Treasury failed to provide Federal Reserve with CIA information concerning BCCI's ownership of First American (1985-1986)**
- Justice Department, Customs, and Treasury failed to provide adequate investigative support

**Settlement (December 1993):** Mahfouz (key BCCI figure) paid $225 million settlement to Federal Reserve and New York County DA; $35 million to U.S. Treasury; $1 million split between New York authorities

**Post-BCCI Reforms:** Following PATRIOT Act anti-money laundering regulations, Treasury issued "temporary" exemptions for real estate, private equity, escrow agents, and luxury goods—regulations highlighted by BCCI scandal

**Historical Assessment:** Manhattan DA Robert Morgenthau called BCCI "the largest bank fraud in world financial history"

### **7. CONTINUUM CONNECTIONS: FINANCIAL CRIMES, INTELLIGENCE, AND INSTITUTIONAL COOPERATION**

**A. BCCI Case as Template**
- BCCI scandal exposed systemic failures in inter-agency coordination between intelligence (CIA), regulation (Federal Reserve, OCC), and law enforcement (FBI, DOJ)
- Treasury's role in post-BCCI intelligence integration established precedent for financial intelligence as national security function

**B. FinCEN as Intelligence-Led Financial Enforcement**
- FinCEN established (1990) and formalized as bureau (2002) to correct BCCI-era failures
- Operates as official U.S. Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), member of Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units (147 FIUs globally)
- **Intelligence sharing with:** FBI, DEA, CIA, NSA (SWIFT surveillance), NGA, DIA, law enforcement agencies, international FIUs

**C. Treasury Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA)**
- Unique institutional arrangement: Only national finance ministry with in-house intelligence agency
- Maintains overseas intelligence offices (Islamabad, Abu Dhabi, others)
- Coordinates with CIA, NSA, FBI, NSC on:
  - **Terrorist financing:** Post-9/11 Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFOS/FINO coordination)
  - **Interagency targeting:** Weekly PCC sub-group meetings (NSC, Treasury, CIA, FBI, State) 2002-2004 on criminal/intelligence priorities
  - **Threat finance cells:** Iraq and Afghan Threat Finance Cells (blended intelligence, military, law enforcement personnel)
  - **National estimates:** OIA coordinates CIA National Intelligence Estimates and CIA studies drafting

**D. Financial Crimes Enforcement Nexus**
- OFAC sanctions as tool of foreign policy and national security
- FinCEN's Bank Secrecy Act intelligence feeds law enforcement investigations (organized crime, drug trafficking, terrorism financing)
- Treasury-CIA SWIFT data exploitation post-9/11 represents classified financial intelligence capability

**E. Historical Continuity**
- Hamilton's Treasury (1789) established precedent for financial intelligence as national security function
- BCCI scandal (1991) demonstrated risks of institutional separation; post-BCCI reforms centralized financial intelligence in Treasury
- Current Treasury apparatus (OIA + FinCEN + OFAC) represents integrated financial intelligence-enforcement-sanctions operation
