## Historical Overview

### Founding & Origins

The Department of the Treasury is America's second oldest cabinet department, created by Congress on September 2, 1789, just weeks after the Department of State. Alexander Hamilton served as the first Secretary of the Treasury, sworn in September 11, 1789, establishing the foundational financial institutions and policies that enabled the new republic to establish creditworthiness and economic stability.

Hamilton's original Treasury institutionalized federal revenue collection, debt management, and monetary policy that would evolve into today's complex financial regulatory apparatus. The Secretary of the Treasury remains fifth in the presidential line of succession and serves as the chief financial officer of the federal government.

**Key Legislation:**
- Act of September 2, 1789 (establishing Treasury)
- Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (creating Federal Reserve System)
- Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (anti-money laundering framework)
- USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (enhanced financial crimes enforcement)
- Homeland Security Act of 2002 (transferred Secret Service, ATF, Customs to DHS)

### Evolution

- **1789:** Treasury established under Hamilton
- **1913:** Federal Reserve Act creates modern central banking system
- **1970:** Bank Secrecy Act establishes anti-money laundering framework
- **1990:** FinCEN established for financial intelligence
- **2002:** Secret Service, ATF, Customs transferred to new DHS
- **2004:** Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence created

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented information from official sources.*

### IRS Targeting Scandal (2013)

**Treasury Inspector General Findings (May 14, 2013):**

> "The IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions."
>
> — [TIGTA Report](https://www.treasury.gov/tigta)

**Key Facts:**
- IRS Commissioner Steven Miller forced to resign
- Lois Lerner (Director of Tax-Exempt Organizations) invoked Fifth Amendment; retired late 2013
- IRS data center erased 422 backup tapes (March 4, 2014), destroying ~24,000 Lerner emails
- October 2017: TIGTA found IRS targeted BOTH conservative AND liberal organizations (2004-2013)
- October 2015: DOJ closed investigation without charges

### OFAC Sanctions Enforcement (2024-2025)

**Recent Enforcement Actions:**
- December 2024: $1,092,000 settlement for 122 Russia sanctions violations
- November 2024: $4,677,552 penalty for Russia and reporting violations
- 2024: $1,104,408 penalty for 75 Iran sanctions violations
- 2023: Sanctions against Venezuela oil sector companies; shadow fleet vessels blocked

**Enforcement Framework:** Strict liability violations; whistleblower incentives for tips leading to $1M+ penalties.

### BCCI Scandal (1991-1993) — Historical Context

**Background:** Bank of Credit and Commerce International became seventh-largest private bank ($20 billion assets, 400+ branches, 78 countries) before collapse for massive fraud.

**Treasury/Intelligence Failures:**

> CIA knew BCCI's intentions by early 1985 and informed Treasury and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—but information was not shared with Federal Reserve or Justice Department.
>
> — [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report](https://irp.fas.org/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/01exec.htm)

**Key Finding:** Treasury failed to provide Federal Reserve with CIA information concerning BCCI's illegal ownership of First American Bank (1985-1986).

**Settlement:** Mahfouz paid $225 million to Federal Reserve and NY County DA; $35 million to Treasury.

**Assessment:** Manhattan DA Robert Morgenthau called BCCI "the largest bank fraud in world financial history."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Financial Intelligence:** Treasury's unique position as the only finance ministry with an in-house intelligence agency (OIA) creates powerful capabilities for tracking financial flows. The post-9/11 integration of financial intelligence with national security objectives—exemplified by SWIFT data access and terrorist finance tracking—represents a significant expansion of surveillance capabilities that operates largely outside public view.

**Regarding BCCI Lessons:** The BCCI scandal demonstrated catastrophic failures in inter-agency coordination. CIA possessed critical intelligence about bank fraud but Treasury failed to share it with appropriate regulators. The question of whether post-BCCI reforms (FinCEN designation, PATRIOT Act authorities) have truly resolved these coordination problems remains open.

**Regarding IRS Targeting:** The targeting scandal reveals how tax enforcement authority can be weaponized for political purposes. The destruction of backup tapes containing potentially relevant emails raises questions about document preservation and accountability within Treasury bureaus.

**Regarding Sanctions Power:** OFAC's ability to impose economic penalties on individuals and entities worldwide, with strict liability and limited due process, represents extraordinary executive power. The expansion of sanctions programs post-9/11 has created a parallel regulatory enforcement system operating outside traditional judicial constraints.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might assess this agency's role differently:

1. **Financial Security Advocate View:** Treasury's intelligence and sanctions capabilities represent essential tools for protecting the financial system from terrorists, drug traffickers, and rogue states—the alternative is vulnerability to those who would exploit American financial infrastructure.

2. **Civil Liberties Skeptic View:** The expansion of Treasury surveillance powers (FinCEN reporting, SWIFT access, beneficial ownership requirements) creates unprecedented government visibility into private financial transactions without commensurate accountability.

3. **Regulatory Capture Critique:** Treasury's relationship with major financial institutions creates potential conflicts between Wall Street interests and broader public welfare, particularly visible during financial crises.

4. **Federalism Perspective:** IRS enforcement powers and Treasury debt collection authority represent significant federal intrusion into citizens' economic lives, raising constitutional questions about enumerated powers.

5. **International Finance View:** Treasury's dollar weaponization through sanctions may undermine long-term dollar hegemony as adversaries develop alternative payment systems to avoid American financial jurisdiction.
