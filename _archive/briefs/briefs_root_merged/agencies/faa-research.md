- Transition: Ground-based radar → satellite navigation + digital communications
- Benefits: $10.9B value from 200+ implementations (2010-2023)
- Challenges: Four critical program areas face delays (GAO 2024)

### Aircraft Certification
- Boeing 737 MAX oversight (see controversies)
- Breakthrough device designation (2016 21st Century Cures Act)

### FAA Reauthorization Act 2024
- $105.5B package (FY2024-2028)

## 5. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES

### Boeing 737 MAX Certification Failures
- Boeing allowed to "certify 96% of its own work"
- MCAS deflection: Boeing told FAA 0.6°; actual 2.5°
- January 5, 2024: Alaska Airlines door plug blowout (4 bolts missing)
- January 6, 2024: FAA grounded 171 Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft
- Six-week audit: Non-compliance in manufacturing, parts handling
- 737 MAX 7/10 certification delayed to 2026

### Air Traffic Controller Staffing Crisis
- 285 of 313 facilities (91%) below recommended staffing
- 73 facilities missing at least 25% of workforce
- New York region facilities at ~60% staffing
- FAA Chief: Towers will "never" reach full staffing under current system
- 3.9% fewer controllers in 2024 vs. 2013; flights increased 6.5%

### Near-Miss Incidents and Runway Incursions
- 1,757 runway incursions documented (2024)
- 19 serious near-misses in 2023 (highest in 7 years)
- December 2024 LAX: Charter jet near-miss with Delta flight
- Staffing shortages directly linked to increased collision risk

### Implementation Delays
- 50+ open GAO recommendations (since 2020)
- NextGen critical programs face persistent delays
- Congressional frustration over slow reauthorization implementation
