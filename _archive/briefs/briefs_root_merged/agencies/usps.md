## Historical Overview

### Founding & Origins

The U.S. postal system predates the Constitution—Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first Postmaster General in 1775. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress power "to establish Post Offices and post Roads." For nearly 200 years, the Post Office Department operated as a Cabinet-level department.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 transformed the Post Office Department into the United States Postal Service, an independent establishment of the executive branch. This change aimed to remove political patronage from postal operations and create a self-sustaining business model funded by postage revenue rather than taxpayer appropriations.

**Key Legislation:**
- Postal Reorganization Act of 1970
- Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA)
- Postal Service Reform Act of 2022

### Evolution

The USPS operates under a unique mandate: provide universal service to every address in America—currently 167 million delivery points—at uniform prices, while receiving no tax appropriations for operating expenses (receiving ~$50 million annually for free mail for the blind and overseas voting). This combination has become increasingly challenging as first-class mail volume declines due to electronic communications.

## Budget & Funding

### Financial Overview

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | Expenses | Net Loss |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------|
| FY2024 | $79.5B | $89.5B | $9.5B |
| FY2023 | $79.0B | $86.5B | $6.5B |

**Cumulative Losses (FY2007-2024):** ~$109 billion

### Revenue Sources

| Category | Revenue | Trend |
|----------|---------|-------|
| First-Class Mail | Declining | -3.2% volume decline |
| Marketing Mail | Declining | Digital competition |
| Package/Shipping | Growing | Competing with FedEx, UPS, Amazon |
| Services | Stable | Money orders, passports |

### The Pre-Funding Mandate

The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act required USPS to pre-fund 75 years of future retiree health benefits within 10 years—a requirement imposed on no other federal agency or private company. USPS estimates this mandate accounts for 92% of its reported losses. The 2022 Postal Service Reform Act relieved this burden prospectively.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented information from official sources.*

### Structural Financial Crisis

**Mail Volume Decline:**
- FY2024: 112.5 billion pieces (3.2% decline from prior year)
- Peak volume (2006): 213 billion pieces
- Volume has declined nearly 50% since peak

**The Pre-Funding Problem:**
The 2006 PAEA required USPS to pre-fund retiree health benefits—approximately $5.5 billion annually. USPS defaulted on these payments starting in 2012 as they became impossible to meet. The 2022 reform act eliminated future pre-funding requirements and moved retirees to Medicare, but the accumulated financial damage persists.

### DeJoy Reforms and Controversies

Louis DeJoy, appointed Postmaster General in June 2020, implemented the "Delivering for America" 10-year plan:

**Changes Implemented:**
- Removal of mail sorting machines (700+ removed in 2020)
- Elimination of overtime during 2020 election period
- Network consolidation and facility closures
- Reduced service standards (longer delivery times)

**2020 Election Concerns:**
DeJoy's cost-cutting measures coincided with record mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic, generating controversy over potential impacts on ballot delivery. Multiple lawsuits and congressional investigations followed.

**DeJoy Resignation:** March 2025

### Internet Covert Operations Program (iCOP)

USPS Office of Inspector General investigation revealed the postal inspection service was monitoring social media for threats to USPS operations:

**OIG Finding:** The program "exceeded law enforcement authority" by conducting surveillance unrelated to mail crimes or direct threats to postal infrastructure.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the 2006 Pre-Funding Mandate:** The PAEA's pre-funding requirement was, by design or effect, a poison pill for postal finances. No organization—public or private—pre-funds retiree benefits 75 years into the future for employees not yet born. This requirement, championed by those seeking to privatize postal services, created artificial insolvency that justified subsequent service cuts. The 2022 reform came too late to prevent $109 billion in cumulative losses and a decade of declining service quality.

**Regarding Universal Service:** USPS delivers to 167 million addresses regardless of profitability—including rural areas that no private carrier would serve at comparable rates. This social infrastructure subsidizes rural America and small businesses nationwide. The push to run USPS "like a business" ignores that universal service is inherently unprofitable by private-sector standards. The question is whether Americans value this infrastructure enough to support it.

**Regarding DeJoy's Tenure:** The timing of DeJoy's 2020 reforms—removing sorting machines and cutting overtime weeks before an election heavily dependent on mail voting—raised questions about whether operational efficiency was the primary goal. While DeJoy denied political motivation, the appearance of conflict from a major Republican donor appointed by a President openly opposing mail-in voting was unavoidable.

**Regarding Amazon and Package Competition:** USPS delivers many Amazon packages, particularly in rural areas where Amazon's delivery network doesn't reach. This relationship subsidizes Amazon's logistics while USPS bears "last mile" delivery costs. Whether this arrangement benefits USPS (volume) or exploits it (below-cost pricing) remains contested.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might assess this agency's role differently:

1. **Privatization Advocate:** USPS is a 19th-century institution unsuited for the digital age. Private carriers can deliver packages more efficiently. First-class mail has declined irreversibly. The service should be privatized or drastically downsized, with universal service subsidized directly rather than through an unsustainable monopoly.

2. **Public Service Defender:** The Postal Service is critical infrastructure, not a business. Universal service is a public good that cannot be measured by profit. The 2006 pre-funding mandate was sabotage. With proper funding and political support, USPS can adapt to serve evolving communication needs.

3. **Labor Perspective:** USPS provides 640,000 middle-class jobs with benefits—a rarity in modern logistics. The push for "efficiency" means job cuts, reduced wages, and degraded service. Protecting postal workers protects communities.

4. **Rural America View:** USPS is essential to rural life. No private carrier delivers six days a week at uniform rates to remote areas. Postal service consolidation abandons rural communities in favor of urban efficiency metrics.

5. **Modernization Position:** USPS should embrace new services—postal banking, expanded logistics, digital services—rather than defending declining legacy mail. Innovation, not nostalgia, will ensure the Postal Service's relevance.
