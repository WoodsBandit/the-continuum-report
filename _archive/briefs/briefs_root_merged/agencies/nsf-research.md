## 5. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES

### Indirect Cost Debate (2025)
- Universities depend on indirect costs (typically 50%+)
- February 2025: NIH announced 15% cap; DOE/NSF followed
- Federal judge ruled NIH cap illegal
- Major budget threat to research institutions

### China Research Security
- CHIPS and Science Act (2022) restrictions
- "Foreign country of concern": China, North Korea, Russia, Iran
- Research security assessment teams review applications
- Risk mitigation negotiations with institutions

### CHIPS Act Implementation Gap
- TIP Directorate: $20B authorized over 5 years
- Only $410M appropriated to date
- Massive authorization-appropriation gap

### 2025 Employee Complaint
- July 2025: 48 named employees + ~100 anonymous filed complaint
- Allegations: "Politically motivated and legally questionable" actions
- Termination of hundreds of NSF employees alleged
