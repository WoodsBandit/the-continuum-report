July 5, 1865 (established)
April 14, 1865 (legislation signed by Lincoln - night of his assassination)

## FOUNDING LEGISLATION
Act creating Secret Service Division of Treasury Department

---

## TRAGIC TIMING

### Lincoln's Last Official Act
- Legislation to create Secret Service was on President Lincoln's desk
- April 14, 1865: Lincoln signed authorization for Secret Service
- **That same evening:** Lincoln assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre
- One of Lincoln's last official acts created agency that would later protect presidents

### Irony of History
- Secret Service not tasked with presidential protection until 1901
- 36 years passed before agency would guard presidents
- Lincoln might have lived had protection existed
