## WHY THE AEC WAS SPLIT

### Conflict of Interest
- Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had dual responsibilities:
  1. Promote nuclear energy
  2. Regulate nuclear safety
- Critics argued these goals fundamentally conflicted
- Supporters and critics of nuclear power agreed separation needed
- AEC perceived as "unduly favoring the industry it was charged with regulating"

### Earlier History
- 1946: Atomic Energy Act created AEC
- 1954: Atomic Energy Act amended to allow commercial nuclear power
- AEC assigned both promotion and regulation
- Inherent tension became untenable
