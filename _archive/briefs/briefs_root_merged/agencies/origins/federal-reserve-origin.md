## POLITICAL DYNAMICS

### The Divide
- **Aldrich Plan (Republican/Banker):** Central bank controlled by bankers
- **Glass Bill (Democratic/Progressive):** Regional banks with more government oversight

### The Compromise
- Wilson administration merged banker expertise with government control
- Created hybrid: 12 regional banks overseen by Federal Reserve Board in Washington
- Board of Governors appointed by President, confirmed by Senate

## IDEOLOGICAL CONTEXT

### Why Central Banking Was Controversial
- 1907 Panic demonstrated need for banking reform
- But Andrew Jackson had killed the Second Bank of the United States in 1830s
- Deep American suspicion of centralized financial power
- Warburg's challenge: Convince Americans that a central bank need not be a "bankers' bank"
