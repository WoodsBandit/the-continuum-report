## CIRCUMSTANCES OF CREATION

### Congressional Showdown (1908)
In May 1908, Congress banned the loan of Secret Service operatives to any federal department - a direct response to what lawmakers charged was Roosevelt's "grab for executive power."

### Bonaparte's Response
Now having no investigators, Bonaparte had no choice but to create his own force:
- July 26, 1908: Bonaparte ordered investigators to report to Chief Examiner Stanley W. Finch
- This action is celebrated as the beginning of the FBI
- Initial force: 34 agents

### Legacy
Both Attorney General Bonaparte and President Roosevelt (completing terms in March 1909) recommended the force of 34 agents become permanent part of Department of Justice.

- Became Director in 1924
- Served until death in 1972 (48 years)
- Transformed the agency into a powerful national law enforcement organization
