## CREATION OF BLM

### The Merger
- May 16, 1946: Truman submitted Reorganization Plan No. 3 to Congress
- July 16, 1946: BLM came into existence
- Merged two Interior Department agencies:
  1. **General Land Office** (established 1812)
  2. **Grazing Service** (established 1934 as Division of Grazing)

### Why Merge?
- Truman: "Consolidating these two agencies will permit the development of uniform policies"
- Responsibilities overlapped
- Integration allows "more economic use of expert skills"
- Grazing Service had troubled relations with Congress
- Secretary Ickes recommended merger in January 1946
