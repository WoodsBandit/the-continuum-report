## PATH TO CABINET

### JFK's Promise

### LBJ's Hesitation

- Worried Southern congressmen would refuse to work with Weaver
- Many LBJ advisers had "little experience working with Black professionals"

### The Decision
- Bill Moyers rated Weaver highly on potential effectiveness
- Moyers noted Weaver's "strong accomplishments and ability to create teams"
- Johnson concluded Weaver was "best-qualified administrator"
- Passage of Voting Rights Act (1965) reduced obstacles from "Solid South"

### The Appointment
- January 13, 1966: Johnson finally appointed Weaver
- "Civil rights leaders and the Black press celebrated the monumental step"
