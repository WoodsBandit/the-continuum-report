- Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) abuses
- $25,000 campaign check traced to Watergate burglar
- $500,000 in campaign funds paid burglars' legal expenses
- "Wild West" period of secret donations
- Public perception that "political process had been thoroughly corrupted"

### Bipartisan Structure Controversy
- Rep. Wayne Hays (D-OH) designed 6-member structure
- Critics said it was designed to "emasculate" enforcement
- Equal partisan split meant deadlocks on enforcement actions
