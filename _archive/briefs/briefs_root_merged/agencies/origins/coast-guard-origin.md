## HAMILTON'S VISION

### Federalist Paper #12 (November 27, 1787)
- Hamilton described need for federal vessels to enforce tariff laws
- Proposed "armed vessels, stationed judiciously at the entrances of our ports"
- Would be "useful sentinels of the law" at "small expense"
- Vision became Revenue Cutter Service

### Why Revenue Mattered
- Only ways to fund new government:
  1. Sales of public lands
  2. Excise taxes on domestic goods
  3. Custom duties (tariffs)
- Tariffs were 80-95% of federal budget until Civil War
- Smuggling threatened national solvency

## CREATION OF REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE

### The Tariff Act of 1790
- August 4, 1790: Congress passed act
- Authorized construction of ten "cutters"
- Swift, shallow-hulled, single-masted vessels
- Designed for coastal patrol, not ocean voyages

### Original Mission
- Interdict smugglers
- Ensure importers paid customs duties
- Enforce tariff laws
- NOT to guard coast from military enemies
