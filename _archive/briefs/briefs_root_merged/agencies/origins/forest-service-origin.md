## CREATION OF FOREST SERVICE

### Before 1905
- **1891:** Forest Reserve Act authorized withdrawing public land as "forest reserves"
- Reserves managed by Department of Interior
- 63 million acres in reserves by 1905
- Interior Department focused on land disposal, not management

### Transfer Act (1905)
- February 1, 1905: Congress transferred forest reserves from Interior to Agriculture
- Reserves placed under Bureau of Forestry (Pinchot's domain)
- July 1905: Bureau renamed "Forest Service"
- Pinchot deliberately chose "Service" for the name

### Why "Service"?
- Pinchot wanted to remind employees their work served the public
- "Service" emphasized public mission over bureaucracy
- "The greatest good for the greatest number in the long run"
