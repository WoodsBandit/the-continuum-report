## Statement of Public Interest

"Jane Doe" is a legal pseudonym used to protect the identities of alleged victims who brought legal action related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The use of pseudonyms in sex trafficking cases serves the legitimate purpose of protecting victim privacy while allowing access to justice. These court documents were released pursuant to judicial order, reflecting the court's determination that public interest in these proceedings warrants disclosure while maintaining victim anonymity. This analysis examines the procedural role of Jane Doe plaintiffs in Epstein-related litigation.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** "Jane Doe" is a standard legal pseudonym used throughout the Epstein-related litigation to identify alleged victims who sought to pursue legal remedies while protecting their identities. The documentary record from *Giuffre v. Maxwell* references Jane Doe plaintiffs in the context of the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) litigation that preceded the defamation case. According to court filings, Jane Does 1, 2, and others filed a CVRA action in 2008 challenging the non-prosecution agreement reached between Jeffrey Epstein and federal prosecutors. These plaintiffs alleged they were denied their statutory rights as crime victims. The Jane Doe designation represents multiple individuals across various proceedings, each with their own experiences and allegations.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the Jane Doe designation:** The use of "Jane Doe" pseudonyms in sex trafficking cases reflects a judicial balancing of competing interests—the public's right to access court proceedings and the victims' legitimate privacy interests. In our assessment, the widespread use of this designation in Epstein-related litigation reflects both the number of alleged victims and the sensitive nature of the allegations.

**Regarding the CVRA litigation:** The Jane Doe plaintiffs pursued a novel legal strategy by invoking the Crime Victims' Rights Act to challenge the 2008 non-prosecution agreement. In our view, this litigation represented a significant effort to hold the government accountable for allegedly failing to consult with victims before entering into the plea agreement.

**Regarding procedural complexities:** The documentary record reveals extensive procedural battles over privilege, discovery, and related matters involving the Jane Doe plaintiffs. We interpret this as reflecting both the high stakes of the litigation and the vigorous defense mounted by opposing parties.

**Regarding anonymity:** The continued use of pseudonyms even in unsealed documents reflects judicial recognition that alleged trafficking victims face legitimate risks from public identification. This is consistent with standard practice in sex trafficking cases.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Jane Doe designation in these records represents multiple alleged victims who pursued legal remedies through the CVRA and related proceedings. The documentary record establishes that these individuals, through their attorneys, engaged in sustained legal efforts to challenge the 2008 non-prosecution agreement and to obtain access to information about the underlying investigation.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing these same documents might reach different conclusions:

1. **Regarding the number of alleged victims:** The use of multiple Jane Doe designations (Jane Doe 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) suggests numerous alleged victims, though the exact number and overlap between proceedings remains unclear from the publicly available record.

2. **Regarding credibility:** Without access to full testimony or the ability to assess individual credibility, readers should note that Jane Doe designations encompass multiple individuals whose allegations may vary in specificity and evidentiary support.

3. **Regarding the CVRA strategy:** The decision to pursue CVRA litigation rather than direct civil claims against Epstein may reflect strategic legal considerations, victim preferences, or limitations on other remedies.

4. **Regarding anonymity:** Some may question whether continued anonymity is appropriate for all Jane Doe plaintiffs, particularly as some alleged victims (such as Virginia Giuffre) have chosen to publicly identify themselves.

5. **Regarding overlap with other proceedings:** The relationship between Jane Doe plaintiffs in the CVRA case, the Giuffre v. Maxwell defamation case, and subsequent civil litigation involves procedural complexities not fully apparent from individual documents.

6. **Regarding the documentary record:** Many documents related to Jane Doe plaintiffs remain sealed or were not included in the January 2024 unsealing, limiting comprehensive analysis.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of 4 documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation referencing "Jane Doe" plaintiffs.

**What we did not review:**
- Complete CVRA case filings from *Jane Doe v. United States* (S.D. Fla.)
- Sealed documents containing victim identities
- Full deposition transcripts of Jane Doe plaintiffs
- Medical or therapeutic records referenced in discovery disputes
- Documents from subsequent civil litigation by other Jane Doe plaintiffs

**Note on identification:** This brief addresses "Jane Doe" as a collective designation. Individual Jane Doe plaintiffs have distinct experiences and allegations. Some individuals previously designated as Jane Doe have subsequently identified themselves publicly (e.g., Virginia Giuffre, who was Jane Doe 3 in certain proceedings).

**Note on scope:** References to "Jane Doe No. [X]" in court documents may refer to different individuals across different proceedings. The numbering system is case-specific.
