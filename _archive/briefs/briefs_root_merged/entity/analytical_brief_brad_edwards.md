## Statement of Public Interest

Brad Edwards is a Fort Lauderdale-based attorney who has represented numerous alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein in civil proceedings. His work spans over a decade of litigation related to one of the most significant sex trafficking cases in American legal history. Understanding his role provides insight into how victim advocacy operated within a complex legal landscape involving powerful defendants.

These documents were released pursuant to court orders in civil and criminal proceedings. Analysis of Edwards' documented activities serves the public interest by illuminating the legal mechanisms through which victims sought accountability from Epstein's alleged associates, including the prosecution of the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) case that brought significant public attention to the allegations.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of the documentary record, Brad Edwards emerges as a central figure in the legal efforts to hold Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged associates accountable. Edwards represented alleged victims in multiple proceedings, including the landmark CVRA case challenging the 2008 non-prosecution agreement. The documents reveal his involvement in email communications with plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, his participation in depositions, and his co-counsel role with Professor Paul Cassell in federal court proceedings. Notably, defense filings in the Maxwell criminal case raised questions about Edwards' former law firm, Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler, which was the subject of a federal investigation for a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme.

**[ECF Doc. 1320-30](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-30.pdf), Deposition of Virginia Giuffre, May 3, 2016:**

### Address Book Controversy

**[Maxwell Criminal Case Defense Letter](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/maxwell-criminal/maxwell-superseding-indictment-2021-03-29.pdf), November 15, 2021:**

In filings in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, defense counsel raised issues regarding Edwards and an address book:

> "According to Mr. Rodriguez, when he left the Epstein home he took an address book, which he claimed was Epstein's book, and had it in his possession until 2009 when he tried to sell it to Brad Edwards for $50,000."

> "Mr. Edwards was a lawyer with of the Fort Lauderdale law firm of Rothstein Rosenfelt Adler. The firm was under investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida for a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme, involving falsifying documents, including police reports and court pleadings, specifically against Epstein; blackmailing targeted defendants to settle false allegations of sexual harassment and abuse; and devising an investment scheme involving pre-trial funding in the guise of structured settlements."

The defense argued that Alfredo Rodriguez "knew the target of his intended sale which makes the likelihood of alteration all the more probable."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Edwards' Role:** In our assessment, the documentary record indicates Brad Edwards was a significant legal advocate for alleged Epstein victims over an extended period. His work spanned multiple cases across different jurisdictions, demonstrating sustained involvement in this litigation.

**Regarding the Law Firm Controversy:** We note that the Maxwell defense's assertions about Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler were made in the context of challenging evidence admissibility. The firm's Ponzi scheme scandal is a matter of public record, and the defense used this history to question the provenance of proposed evidence. The documents do not establish that Edwards personally participated in any wrongdoing related to the firm's fraudulent activities.

**Regarding the Privilege Log Communications:** We observe that the extensive protected communications between Edwards and plaintiff Giuffre appear consistent with standard attorney-client relationships. The joint defense privilege assertions suggest coordinated legal strategy among multiple counsel representing related interests.

**Our editorial judgment:** Brad Edwards appears in the documentary record as an attorney who represented alleged victims in complex, high-profile litigation. The defense attacks on his former firm's credibility should be viewed within the adversarial context of criminal trial proceedings.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **Victim Advocacy Interpretation:** Edwards' sustained representation of alleged victims, spanning over a decade, may reflect dedicated advocacy for individuals harmed by Epstein's alleged crimes.

2. **Professional Obligation Interpretation:** The attorney-client communications documented in privilege logs simply reflect routine legal representation rather than evidence of any particular significance.

3. **Defense Strategy Interpretation:** The Maxwell defense's attacks on Edwards' former law firm may represent standard adversarial tactics to discredit evidence rather than substantive allegations against Edwards personally.

4. **Timing Interpretation:** Edwards' departure from Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler and later association with different firms could suggest he was not involved in the fraudulent activities, or alternatively could reflect circumstances surrounding the firm's collapse.

5. **Incomplete Record Interpretation:** The available documents represent only portions of proceedings. Edwards' full role and the context of his activities may be more complex than the documentary fragments suggest.

6. **Coordination Interpretation:** The joint defense arrangements documented in privilege logs could reflect either ordinary legal coordination or more extensive strategic alignment among counsel and parties.

7. **Address Book Interpretation:** Whether Alfredo Rodriguez actually attempted to sell materials to Edwards, and whether Edwards had any knowledge of the alleged alterations, cannot be determined from the available documents.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
