## Statement of Public Interest

Juan Alessi served as house manager at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence for approximately eleven years (1991-2002). He provided extensive sworn testimony to the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office on November 21, 2005, deposition testimony in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case, and testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial. His testimony provides detailed first-hand observations of household operations, visitor patterns, massage activities, and the apparent ages of young women visiting the residence during the period relevant to criminal allegations.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Juan Alessi represents one of the most significant first-hand witnesses to operations at Epstein's Palm Beach residence. His lengthy employment (approximately eleven years) and position as house manager gave him direct observation of household activities, visitors, and patterns. His November 2005 sworn statement to investigators, his deposition testimony in Giuffre v. Maxwell, and his testimony at Maxwell's criminal trial provided detailed accounts of young women visiting the residence, massage sessions, and the roles of various individuals including Ghislaine Maxwell. Critically, Alessi testified that masseuses appeared to be "sixteen or seventeen years old at the most" and that he would clean sex toys after massage sessions. Alessi was not charged with any crime and cooperated with investigators despite initial resistance after being contacted by a private investigator from Epstein's defense team.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented facts from court records without editorial comment.*

### Employment at Epstein Residence

Juan Alessi worked as house manager at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence from approximately 1991 to 2002. His wife, Maria Alessi, also worked for Epstein from 1994 to 2002, performing house cleaning and shopping duties. His responsibilities included:
- Managing household staff
- Maintaining the property
- Greeting visitors
- General household management duties
- Post-massage cleanup duties

### Palm Beach Police Investigation — November 2005

**[ECF Doc. 1320-13](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-13.pdf) (Filed 01/03/24) — Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report:**

The Palm Beach Police Department investigation records document law enforcement's attempts to interview Juan Alessi:

- **November 9, 2005:** Detective Joseph Recarey attempted to interview Juan Alessi at his residence at 6791 Fairway Lakes Drive in Boynton Beach, Florida. Alessi was not home.

- **November 11, 2005 (approximately):** Alessi was contacted by a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy Black (Epstein's criminal defense attorney). The investigator met with Alessi at Carrabba's Restaurant in Boynton Beach.

- **November 13, 2005:** Alessi called Detective Recarey's phone but subsequently hired Attorney Donald Morrell, who prevented direct police contact.

- **November 21, 2005:** Detective Recarey met with Juan and Maria Alessi at the State Attorney's Office with ASA Weiss and Attorney Donnie Murrell present.

### Sworn Testimony — November 21, 2005

**[ECF Doc. 1320-11](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-11.pdf) (Filed 01/03/24):**

This declaration references Juan Alessi's "November 21, 2005 Sworn Statement" as Exhibit 8 in support of plaintiff's motion in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case.

**Key testimony from the sworn statement (as documented in ECF Doc. 1320-13):**

Juan Alessi testified that:
- Epstein had "up to three massages a day"
- The masseuses were "younger and younger" toward the end of his employment
- The young women appeared to be "sixteen or seventeen years old at the most"
- He would "wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis" after massage sessions
- Another former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, worked for approximately six months after Alessi left

### Deposition Testimony — Giuffre v. Maxwell

**[ECF Doc. 1327-24](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-24.pdf) (Filed 01/05/24):**

Alessi provided deposition testimony in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case. Key topics addressed included:
- Visitor patterns at the Palm Beach residence
- Observations of young women at the property
- Ghislaine Maxwell's presence and activities
- Massage sessions and household routines
- Other staff members and their roles

**[ECF Doc. 1320-18](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-18.pdf) (Filed 01/03/24):**

This legal filing references Alessi's testimony in the context of the CVRA case, noting that he testified that Dershowitz came "pretty often" to Epstein's Florida mansion and "got massages while he was there."

**[ECF Doc. 1320-20](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-20.pdf) (Filed 01/03/24):**

Maxwell's response in opposition to additional depositions identifies Juan Alessi as one of the former Epstein employees already deposed by plaintiff, along with Johanna Sjoberg and David Rodgers.

### Criminal Trial Testimony

Juan Alessi testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's federal criminal trial in the Southern District of New York (2021). His testimony was cited in coverage of the trial and contributed to the evidentiary record supporting Maxwell's conviction.

### Contact by Epstein Defense Team

The police records document that approximately two days after detectives first attempted contact, a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy Black (Epstein's criminal defense attorney) contacted Alessi and met with him at a restaurant. This contact preceded Alessi's decision to hire his own attorney.

### Cooperation with Law Enforcement

Despite initial hesitation and hiring an attorney, Alessi ultimately cooperated with the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office investigation and provided sworn testimony. He was not charged with any crime related to Epstein's activities.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the significance of his testimony:** Alessi's testimony is particularly significant because it comes from an eleven-year employee who had daily access to observe patterns at the residence. His testimony about increasingly younger masseuses and his duties cleaning sex toys after massage sessions provides direct evidence of awareness within the household of sexual activity connected to the massages.

**Regarding the private investigator contact:** The timing of contact from Epstein's defense team—within days of police attempting to interview Alessi—raises questions about how Epstein's team learned of the investigation and witness identification. This pattern of rapid defense team response appears throughout the investigation records.

**Regarding witness credibility:** Alessi's testimony carries weight due to his extended employment period (eleven years), his position with direct observation access, and his ultimate willingness to cooperate with both civil litigation and criminal prosecution despite initial resistance. As house manager, he was positioned to observe patterns that transient visitors would not see.

**Regarding his non-defendant status:** Alessi was not charged despite his lengthy employment during the relevant period and his admitted knowledge of concerning activities. This suggests prosecutors determined he was a witness rather than a participant in criminal activity.

**Regarding the scope of observations:** His testimony about cleaning sex toys and observing that masseuses appeared to be minors demonstrates that household staff were aware of the nature of activities occurring during "massage" sessions.

**Our editorial judgment:** Juan Alessi represents a key witness whose testimony helped establish the evidentiary foundation for understanding Epstein's Palm Beach operations. His observations corroborate the accounts of victims regarding the presence of young women and the sexual nature of massage sessions. His cooperation with law enforcement and willingness to testify publicly distinguishes him from witnesses who invoked the Fifth Amendment or refused to cooperate.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Employee limitations:** Employees may not understand the full context of what they observe. Alessi's estimate of ages may have been inaccurate, and his interpretations of events may be colored by subsequent knowledge he did not have during employment.

- **Retrospective testimony:** Testimony given years after events may be affected by memory limitations, media coverage, or knowledge gained after the fact.

- **Defense team contact:** The contact by a private investigator may have been routine investigation activity rather than improper witness contact.

- **Legal pressure:** Alessi may have cooperated with prosecutors to avoid potential liability, which could affect the nature of his testimony.

- **Observation vs. knowledge:** Observing visitors at a residence and cleaning objects does not establish complete knowledge of criminal activity. Household staff may have been deliberately kept unaware of certain activities.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
