## Statement of Public Interest

Great St. James Island represents a significant component of Jeffrey Epstein's real estate holdings in the U.S. Virgin Islands and features prominently in civil litigation brought by the USVI government. The island's purchase in 2016, its alleged purpose according to court filings, and the environmental violations that occurred during construction there are matters of public record and ongoing public interest. The $105 million settlement between the Epstein estate and USVI, which included provisions for environmental remediation on Great St. James, reflects governmental determination that the property was connected to alleged criminal activity. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse on matters of significant governmental and public interest.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Great St. James Island, approximately 165 acres located southeast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, was purchased by Jeffrey Epstein in January 2016 for approximately $22.5 million through a shell company, Great St. Jim LLC. In our assessment, the documentary record suggests this acquisition was strategically significant: according to the USVI government's civil complaint, Epstein allegedly purchased the neighboring island to prevent surveillance of his activities on Little St. James and to create additional barriers preventing escape or rescue of trafficking victims. The island became the subject of environmental violations when Epstein began construction without proper permits, including the alleged destruction of colonial-era historical structures. Following Epstein's death and subsequent settlement with the USVI government, both islands were sold in 2023 for $60 million combined, with half the proceeds going to the USVI government.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents and official sources without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Purchase Details (January 2016)

According to publicly available records and court filings:

Great St. James Island was purchased in two transactions in January 2016:

- **January 18, 2016:** Three parcels purchased from Christian Kjaer family interests through Great St. Jim LLC for $17.5 million
- **January 21, 2016:** Twelve additional parcels (81.22 acres) purchased from GSJ Properties Corp. through the same LLC for $5 million

The total acquisition cost was approximately $22.5 million.

Prior to sale, the Kjaer family had owned the island since the late 1970s. According to Danish newspaper B.T., islanders had previously "begged" the Kjaer family not to sell to Epstein due to rumors about his "sexual preferences."

### USVI Government Allegations

**[USVI v. JPMorgan Complaint](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/financial-enablers/2022-USVI-V-JPMORGAN-COMPLAINT-EPSTEIN-TRAFFICKING.pdf), filed 12/27/22:**

The USVI Attorney General's complaint referenced Epstein's ownership of both islands:

> "These entities held properties, including Little St. James and Great St. James, at which Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls."

The complaint identified Great St. Jim LLC as:

> "Great St. Jim, LLC is a limited liability company established under the laws of the Virgin Islands, organized on October 26, 2015. Great St. Jim, LLC, according to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, owns at least three properties that make up Great St. James acquired on January 28, 2016, with combined valuations of over $23 million."

### Alleged Purpose of Acquisition

According to USVI government filings and news reports, Virgin Islands lawyers alleged Epstein purchased Great St. James:

> "to obscure the smaller island from surveillance"

The USVI lawsuit further alleged:

> "By acquiring ownership and control of Great St. James to the exclusion of others, the Epstein Enterprise created additional barriers to prevent those held involuntarily on Little St. James from escaping or obtaining help from others."

### Construction Plans and Permits

According to permit applications filed with the V.I. Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR), Epstein's plans for Great St. James included:

- Barge dock
- Two homes
- Cottages
- Amphitheater
- Gardens
- Marine electrical cable
- Solar array and generator
- Storage building
- Security building
- Workshed
- Machine shop
- "Underwater office and pool"

### Environmental Violations and Stop-Work Orders

According to the Virgin Islands Daily News and DPNR records:

**December 21, 2018:** DPNR issued a stop-work order after construction exceeded permitted scope.

Commissioner Jean-Pierre Oriol stated regarding the violations:

> "an excessive amount of additional roadways that have been carved out on the island, there have been two jetties, fill material has been placed into the submerged lands, so there's evidence of work going beyond what was initially applied for."

**Historical Pattern:** DPNR had previously issued stop-work orders twice for Little St. James when construction exceeded permitted plans. A civil penalty of $140,000-$180,000 was issued in 2016 for violations on Little St. James.

The USVI complaint noted:

> "Because of Epstein's enormous wealth, these fines had little effect in curbing or stopping the Epstein Enterprise's unlawful conduct or conforming its activities to the law."

### Destruction of Historical Structures

According to USVI government findings:

Epstein's construction on Great St. James allegedly resulted in the destruction of colonial-era historical structures associated with the island's enslaved population history.

The estate was required to pay $450,000 specifically for:

> "environmental damage on Great St. James, another island Epstein owned where authorities say he removed the ruins of colonial-era historical structures of slaves."

### Settlement and Sale

**December 2022:** USVI government settled with Epstein estate for:
- $105 million cash payment
- Half of proceeds from sale of Little St. James and Great St. James
- $450,000 for environmental remediation on Great St. James

**May 2023:** Both islands sold to Stephen Deckoff (Black Diamond Capital Management) for $60 million combined. Deckoff announced plans to develop the islands as a luxury resort.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the strategic acquisition:** In our assessment, the timing and manner of the Great St. James purchase suggests deliberate planning. Epstein acquired the neighboring island in 2016 -- eight years after his 2008 conviction and registration as a sex offender -- through a shell company formed just months earlier. The USVI government's theory that the purchase was intended to prevent surveillance and limit escape routes appears plausible given the proximity of the islands and the alleged nature of activities on Little St. James.

**Regarding construction activity:** The pattern of unpermitted construction followed by payment of fines, repeated on both islands, suggests what we interpret as a calculated approach to regulatory compliance: Epstein could afford to treat penalties as a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent. The stop-work orders appear to have had limited practical effect.

**Regarding the destruction of historical structures:** We view the alleged removal of colonial-era ruins as particularly significant. These structures, connected to the history of enslaved people in the Virgin Islands, represent irreplaceable historical and cultural heritage. The $450,000 remediation payment, while substantial, cannot restore what was allegedly destroyed.

**Regarding the purchase price disparity:** Epstein acquired Great St. James for approximately $22.5 million in 2016. Seven years later, both islands sold for $60 million combined. This suggests the combined value depreciated significantly, likely due to the islands' association with Epstein's alleged crimes and the publicity surrounding them.

**Our editorial judgment:** Great St. James Island appears, based on the documentary record, to have been acquired as infrastructure for an alleged criminal enterprise rather than for legitimate residential or commercial purposes. The USVI government's characterization of the purchase as designed to facilitate trafficking by preventing surveillance and escape represents one plausible interpretation supported by the geographic and temporal facts.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing the documentary record might consider:

1. **Legitimate privacy interest.** Wealthy individuals routinely purchase neighboring properties to ensure privacy and prevent unwanted development. Epstein's acquisition of Great St. James could have been motivated by ordinary privacy concerns rather than concealment of criminal activity. Many property owners seek to control neighboring land.

2. **Development plans were genuine.** The extensive construction plans -- homes, cottages, amphitheater, solar arrays -- suggest plans for legitimate development. The "underwater office and pool" concept, while unusual, has been implemented in luxury resorts worldwide. The project may have been an ambitious personal vision.

3. **Permit violations reflect construction industry norms.** Exceeding permitted scope during construction is common in the building industry. Payment of fines and remediation is the standard resolution. The pattern on Epstein's islands may not differ materially from other large-scale construction projects.

4. **The surveillance allegation is speculative.** The claim that Great St. James was purchased "to obscure surveillance" is a litigation allegation, not a proven fact. No evidence has been presented showing Epstein articulated this purpose. The islands are 0.25 miles apart, and surveillance from the larger island would have been limited.

5. **Historical structure destruction may have been inadvertent.** Large-scale land clearing often uncovers or damages unidentified historical artifacts. The structures may not have been clearly marked or their significance recognized during initial site preparation. The $450,000 payment suggests acknowledgment of damage, not necessarily intentional destruction.

6. **Shell company use is standard practice.** Using LLCs to hold real estate is common among high-net-worth individuals for liability protection, tax planning, and privacy. Great St. Jim LLC's structure does not inherently indicate concealment.

7. **Settlement amounts reflect litigation risk, not proven facts.** The $105 million estate settlement and $450,000 environmental payment were negotiated resolutions. Defendants may settle for business reasons unrelated to admissions of the underlying allegations.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through review of the USVI v. JPMorgan complaint (publicly available federal court filing), USVI government announcements, and verified news reporting from multiple outlets.

**What we did not review:**
- USVI v. Epstein Estate original complaint and Second Amended Complaint (referenced in secondary sources)
- Great St. Jim LLC formation documents and property deeds (Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds)
- V.I. DPNR permit applications and stop-work orders (referenced in news reporting)
- Detailed environmental impact assessments
- FBI investigative files regarding island activities
- Evidence or testimony from Maxwell criminal trial specific to Great St. James
- Internal communications regarding purchase decision

**Note:** Great St. James Island is distinct from Little St. James Island, which was Epstein's primary residence in the Virgin Islands. Most victim testimony and allegations refer to Little St. James specifically. The record regarding criminal activity occurring specifically on Great St. James is limited, with the USVI government's allegations focusing primarily on the strategic purpose of the acquisition rather than events on the island itself.
