## Statement of Public Interest

The flight logs from Jeffrey Epstein's private aircraft constitute some of the most significant documentary evidence in litigation related to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking operation. These pilot logbooks, maintained by David Rodgers and Larry Visoski, documented passengers traveling on Epstein's Boeing 727 (dubbed "Lolita Express" in media accounts) and Gulfstream aircraft between Epstein's various properties including Palm Beach, New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, and international destinations.

The logs became central evidence in civil litigation, providing contemporaneous documentation of who traveled with Epstein and when. These records were entered as exhibits in multiple court proceedings and were unsealed as part of the January 2024 document release, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The flight logs from Jeffrey Epstein's aircraft represent contemporaneous documentary records maintained by professional pilots as part of aviation requirements. In our assessment, these logbooks provide objective documentation of passenger travel that cannot be easily disputed or attributed to faulty memory. Court filings in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case extensively reference these logs to establish travel patterns of Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Virginia Giuffre, and numerous other individuals.

Based on our review of court filings, the logs document that Maxwell traveled on Epstein's aircraft over 300 times, including 23 flights with Virginia Giuffre when Giuffre was underage. The logs were maintained by pilots David Rodgers and Larry Visoski and were entered as exhibits in the June 3, 2016 deposition of David Rodgers (ECF Doc. 1328-14). The documentary evidence encompasses flights spanning approximately the 1990s through the 2000s, covering travel to Epstein's properties in Florida, New York, New Mexico, the Caribbean, and international destinations.

### Evidence of Flight Log Documentation

**[ECF Doc. 1320-6](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-6.pdf), filed 01/03/24** (Plaintiff's Unredacted Reply in Support of Motion to Compel):

> "Yet, according to flight manifests, in that same general time period, Defendant was listed as a passenger at least eleven times either landing in or departing from West Palm Beach, Florida on Jeffrey Epstein's private plane."

> "Moreover, again according to flight logs, Defendant was on Epstein's planes over 300 times - including 23 times with Ms. Giuffre when Ms. Giuffre was underage. Yet, quite remarkably, Defendant claimed she 'couldn't recall' even one of those flights."

> "Defendant even testified that she did not recall having Ms. Giuffre at her London townhome with Prince Andrew. Defendant stuck to this incredible story despite flight logs establishing her traveling to London with Ms. Giuffre and despite a photograph the three - Ms. Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Defendant - all standing together in Defendant's home."

### Deposition Reference to Flight Logs

**[ECF Doc. 1328-8](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-8.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Declaration of Sigrid S. McCawley):

> "Attached hereto as Sealed Exhibit 9 are true and correct copies of flight logs excerpted Rodgers Dep. Ex. 1."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding evidentiary significance:** In our assessment, the flight logs represent some of the most important documentary evidence in the Epstein-related litigation. Unlike witness testimony that can be challenged on grounds of memory, bias, or credibility, pilot logbooks are contemporaneous records created as part of aviation regulatory requirements. They provide objective documentation of who was present on flights and when.

**Regarding their use in litigation:** Court filings extensively cite the flight logs to establish patterns of travel and association. The assertion that Maxwell traveled with Giuffre 23 times while Giuffre was underage, and that Maxwell appeared on Epstein's aircraft over 300 times, derives from these records. In our view, this contemporaneous documentation was particularly powerful because it contradicted Maxwell's deposition testimony that she "couldn't recall" flights documented in the logs.

**Regarding the London trip:** The flight logs, combined with the famous photograph of Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell in Maxwell's London townhome, appear to corroborate Giuffre's account of traveling to London. Court filings note that Maxwell testified she did not recall having Giuffre at her London townhome "despite flight logs establishing her traveling to London with Ms. Giuffre."

**Regarding scope and limitations:** The flight logs document presence on aircraft - they establish who traveled together and when. They do not, by themselves, establish what occurred at destinations or the nature of relationships between passengers. The evidentiary value lies in their ability to corroborate or contradict testimony about travel and associations.

**Regarding prominent passengers:** The logs document flights involving numerous prominent individuals. In our assessment, presence on these aircraft establishes social or professional connection to Epstein but does not, by itself, establish knowledge of or participation in alleged criminal activity. Many passengers may have traveled for legitimate business or social purposes with no awareness of Epstein's alleged crimes.

**Regarding availability:** While portions of the flight logs have been released or quoted in court filings, the complete logs do not appear to be fully available in the public record. Court filings reference and quote from them, but comprehensive analysis is limited by incomplete public access.

**Our editorial judgment:** The flight logs constitute critical documentary evidence that provided contemporaneous corroboration (or contradiction) of witness testimony. Their evidentiary power lies in their nature as routine business records created for aviation compliance purposes, not litigation. The logs have been central to establishing travel patterns in civil litigation and remain significant documentary evidence regarding Epstein's operations.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Flight logs document presence, not conduct.** Being listed as a passenger on an aircraft establishes only that a person traveled on that flight. It does not establish the purpose of travel, knowledge of other passengers' activities, or participation in any alleged wrongdoing.

2. **Many passengers had legitimate purposes.** Epstein maintained a wide social and business circle. Many individuals appearing on flight logs may have traveled for entirely legitimate reasons - business meetings, social events, philanthropic activities - with no knowledge of alleged criminal conduct.

3. **The "300 flights" and "23 flights" figures require context.** Maxwell worked for Epstein for approximately 17 years. Over that period, 300 flights may not be unusual for someone in her professional role. Similarly, 23 flights with Giuffre present does not establish Maxwell's knowledge of Giuffre's age or any illegal purpose.

4. **Memory limitations are reasonable.** Maxwell's testimony that she could not recall specific flights from years or decades earlier may reflect genuine memory limitations rather than evasion. Most people would struggle to recall specific trips from that long ago.

5. **Incomplete records may affect analysis.** If the publicly available flight logs are incomplete, conclusions drawn from them may not reflect the full picture of travel patterns.

6. **Aviation records have limitations.** Pilot logbooks may not capture every passenger or may contain errors. Names may be abbreviated, misspelled, or informally recorded.

7. **Association does not equal culpability.** The documentary record of travel together does not establish that all passengers knew of alleged crimes or were participants in them. Social and professional relationships often involve travel without criminal implications.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

**What we did review:**
- Court filings referencing flight logs and their evidentiary use
- Deposition excerpts discussing flight logs
- Rule 26 disclosures identifying pilots and flight log evidence
- Motions citing statistics from flight logs

**What we did not review:**
- Complete, unredacted flight logs in their original form
- Full deposition transcript of David Rodgers
- Full deposition transcript of Larry Visoski
- Complete passenger manifests for all flights
- Aviation records from FAA or other regulatory sources

**Critical limitation:** The complete flight logs do not appear to be fully available in the public record. This analysis relies on court filings that reference and quote from the logs, but complete primary source review was not possible. Statistics cited (e.g., "over 300 flights," "23 flights") derive from court filings and could not be independently verified against original records.
