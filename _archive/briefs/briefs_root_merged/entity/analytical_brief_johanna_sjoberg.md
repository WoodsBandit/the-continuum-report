## Statement of Public Interest

Johanna Sjoberg is an alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein who provided sworn deposition testimony in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case. Her testimony addresses her experiences with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including detailed accounts of recruitment methods, activities at Epstein's properties in Palm Beach and New York, and observations of numerous prominent individuals. Sjoberg's first-hand account contributes significantly to understanding the operation's methods of targeting and exploiting young women through seemingly legitimate employment opportunities.

The unsealing of these court documents was ordered by the court due to significant public interest in the Epstein case. Analysis of this testimony serves the public interest in understanding documented patterns of exploitation.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of the court record, Johanna Sjoberg represents both a victim and a key witness in the Epstein case. Her 2016 deposition testimony in Giuffre v. Maxwell provides detailed first-hand accounts of her recruitment while a college student at Palm Beach Atlantic College, her experiences performing massages at Epstein's properties, and her observations of individuals including Ghislaine Maxwell, Prince Andrew, Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, and others. Her testimony includes significant self-reflection about her participation, characterizing her involvement as having "made a pact with the devil in exchange for excitement and glamour." The documentary record suggests Sjoberg's account corroborates elements of other victims' testimony regarding recruitment methods and the roles of key individuals in the operation.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the recruitment method:** In our assessment, Sjoberg's account of being recruited through an apparent job opportunity while attending Palm Beach Atlantic College illustrates a documented pattern in the Epstein operation. Targeting college students with employment offers creates an appearance of legitimacy that victims have described as initially disarming. This recruitment method—using the guise of legitimate work—appears consistently throughout victim accounts.

**Regarding her self-assessment:** We view Sjoberg's characterization of having "made a pact with the devil" as a significant statement reflecting victim psychology. Her acknowledgment of being "hard-up and foolish" as a college student illustrates how financial vulnerability was exploited. This self-reflection, expressed years after the events, suggests the complex and lasting psychological impact on victims.

**Regarding testimony about prominent individuals:** Sjoberg's deposition addressed numerous prominent individuals. We interpret her testimony as providing contemporaneous observations by someone who was present at Epstein's properties. The testimony regarding specific individuals varies in detail and nature—some individuals are mentioned in passing, others in connection with specific incidents.

**Regarding testimony corroboration:** In our assessment, Sjoberg's testimony gains significance from its consistency with other victim accounts. When multiple independent witnesses describe similar recruitment methods, similar locations (El Brillo Way, New York townhouse), and similar individuals (Maxwell, Kellen, Marcinkova), the collective testimony carries more weight than any single account.

**Our editorial judgment:** Johanna Sjoberg's deposition represents valuable first-hand documentation of the Epstein operation. Her testimony addresses recruitment methods, activities at properties, and the involvement of numerous individuals. Her candid self-reflection about her own participation adds authenticity to her account. The record she provided contributed to the evidentiary foundation for Maxwell's criminal prosecution.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing these same documents might reach different conclusions:

1. **Civil litigation context:** The deposition was given in civil litigation where financial interests and legal strategy may influence testimony. The adversarial nature of depositions may affect how information is elicited and presented.

2. **Memory and retrospection:** The events described occurred approximately a decade before the 2016 testimony. Memory can be affected by time, subsequent media coverage, and discussions with others.

3. **Self-serving characterizations:** Sjoberg's self-characterization as "foolish" and having made a "pact with the devil" could be interpreted as minimizing agency or emphasizing victimhood for litigation purposes.

4. **Name-dropping concerns:** The mention of numerous prominent individuals may reflect genuine observations, but could also reflect pressure to identify notable persons or confusion about identities over time.

5. **Limited documentary evidence:** Deposition testimony represents one person's account. Corroboration through documentary evidence (photos, records, logs) varies for different claims made.

6. **Varying levels of significance:** Mentions of individuals range from alleged direct interaction to merely having seen someone at a property. These different levels of connection should not be conflated.

7. **Partial release:** The public record contains excerpts and filings rather than complete testimony, limiting full evaluation of context and cross-examination.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
