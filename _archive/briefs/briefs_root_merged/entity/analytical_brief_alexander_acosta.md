## Statement of Public Interest

Alexander Acosta served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009, during which time his office negotiated and approved the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein. This agreement has been described as one of the most controversial prosecutorial decisions in modern American legal history. In February 2019, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that federal prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by concealing the NPA from identified victims. The DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility subsequently investigated the conduct of Acosta and other prosecutors, releasing its findings in November 2020. Acosta's later service as Secretary of Labor and his July 2019 resignation amid renewed scrutiny of the Epstein matter amplify the public interest in understanding his role. These documents derive from federal court proceedings, judicial rulings, and government reports—all matters of significant public concern. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** R. Alexander Acosta served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009 and later as U.S. Secretary of Labor from 2017 to 2019. In our assessment, Acosta's most consequential professional decision was approving the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, which allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state prostitution charges while avoiding federal sex trafficking prosecution.

Based on our review of the documentary record, Acosta's office negotiated an agreement that: (1) protected Epstein from federal prosecution on charges that could have resulted in substantial prison time; (2) granted immunity to unnamed "potential co-conspirators"; (3) was concealed from identified victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act according to Judge Marra's 2019 ruling; and (4) resulted in Epstein serving approximately 13 months in county jail with work release privileges.

The November 2020 DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility report concluded that Acosta and other prosecutors exercised "poor judgment" in crafting the plea agreement but did not commit professional misconduct or violate any laws. Acosta has never been criminally charged. He resigned as Secretary of Labor on July 19, 2019, following renewed public scrutiny when Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in New York.

### The Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement (2008)

**[ECF Doc. 1330-1](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1330-1.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Declaration of Paul G. Cassell in *Giuffre v. Maxwell*):

> "On July 7, 2008, Mr. Edwards filed an emergency petition to enforce the rights of 'Jane Doe No. 1' and 'Jane Doe No. 2' under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. Section 3771, alleging that the Government had failed to provide them rights with regard to a plea arrangement it was pursuing with Epstein."

The declaration further states:

> "the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida had concealed from Epstein's victims a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) that they had reached with Epstein."

### Reference in Giuffre v. Maxwell Documents

**[ECF Doc. 1331-36](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-36.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Jeffrey Epstein's Motion to Quash Trial Subpoena):

In a footnote discussing media attention surrounding Epstein, his attorneys wrote:

> "A Google search for 'Jeffrey Epstein' returns 508,000 entries, the most recent of which center on the new nominee for Secretary of Labor, Alexander Acosta, who, when he was United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, approved Mr. Epstein's nonprosecution agreement. See, e.g., New York Daily News, 'Labor Secretary nominee Alexander Acosta gave "sweetheart deal" to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein,' February 16, 2017."

### Judge Kenneth Marra's CVRA Ruling (February 21, 2019)

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that federal prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act when they secretly negotiated the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement without notifying identified victims.

Key findings from Judge Marra's ruling (as reported in public records and news accounts):

> "When the Government gives information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's attorneys, scant information was shared with victims. Instead, the victims were told to be 'patient' while the investigation proceeded."

Judge Marra found that the prosecutors:

> "made a decision to conceal the existence of the [non-prosecution agreement] and mislead the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility."

### DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility Report (November 2020)

The Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility conducted an investigation into the conduct of Acosta and other prosecutors involved in the 2008 NPA. The report, released in November 2020, concluded:

- Acosta and other prosecutors exercised "poor judgment" in several aspects of the plea agreement
- The prosecutors did not commit professional misconduct
- The prosecutors did not violate any laws
- The investigation did not find grounds for disciplinary action

The OPR report examined the decision-making process, the terms of the agreement, and the failure to consult with victims.

### Acosta's Public Statements

At a press conference on July 10, 2019, following Epstein's arrest in New York, Acosta defended the 2008 agreement, stating (per contemporaneous news reports):

> "The goal of a prosecution is to put bad guys in jail... At the end of the day, Mr. Epstein went to jail. He was registered as a sex offender."

Acosta also stated that his office faced challenges in proving the federal case and that the alternative was potentially no jail time at all if the state case proceeded without federal involvement.

### Resignation as Secretary of Labor (July 2019)

On July 12, 2019, President Trump announced that Acosta would resign as Secretary of Labor, effective July 19, 2019. This resignation came days after Epstein's arrest in New York on new federal sex trafficking charges and amid renewed scrutiny of the 2008 plea agreement.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the Non-Prosecution Agreement:** In our view, the 2008 NPA negotiated under Acosta's leadership represents a striking deviation from standard federal prosecution practice for sex crimes involving multiple minor victims. The agreement's key features—immunity for unnamed co-conspirators, concealment from victims, state rather than federal charges, minimal jail time with work release—appear, in our assessment, to have been extraordinarily favorable to the defendant given the scope of alleged criminal conduct.

**Regarding the CVRA violation:** Judge Marra's finding that prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by concealing the NPA from victims suggests, in our interpretation, a deliberate decision to exclude victims from a process in which they had statutory rights to participate. The ruling describes prosecutors as spending "untold hours" negotiating with defense counsel while sharing "scant information" with victims.

**Regarding the OPR findings:** We observe that the OPR report concluded Acosta exercised "poor judgment" without finding professional misconduct. In our assessment, this distinction may reflect the difficulty of establishing ethical violations in the context of prosecutorial discretion, where courts generally afford prosecutors wide latitude. The finding of "poor judgment" nevertheless represents an institutional acknowledgment that the process was flawed.

**Regarding Acosta's defense:** Acosta's July 2019 press conference defense—that the alternative to the NPA might have been no jail time at all—represents one interpretation of the prosecutorial calculus. We note that this explanation does not address why co-conspirators received immunity, why victims were not consulted, or why the agreement was kept secret.

**Regarding the timing of scrutiny:** We observe that substantive public accountability for the 2008 NPA did not occur until after Acosta was nominated for Secretary of Labor in 2017, and intensified only after Epstein's 2019 arrest. This eleven-year gap between the agreement and meaningful scrutiny raises questions, in our view, about institutional oversight of prosecutorial decisions.

**Regarding Acosta's legal status:** Alexander Acosta has never been charged with any crime. The OPR investigation found no basis for professional discipline. His resignation from the Labor Department was voluntary, though it followed intense public pressure. Any characterization of wrongdoing remains a matter of opinion based on the documentary record.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record supports characterizing the 2008 NPA as an unusual and consequential prosecutorial decision that prioritized closure over accountability. Judge Marra's CVRA ruling, the OPR's "poor judgment" finding, and the subsequent reopening of federal investigation suggest institutional acknowledgment that the process was deficient. However, the question of whether Acosta's decisions reflected mere poor judgment, systemic bias favoring wealthy defendants, or other factors remains a matter of interpretation on which reasonable observers may differ.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Prosecutorial discretion is intentionally broad.** Acosta may have made reasonable professional judgments about evidence quality, trial risks, and resource constraints. The decision to accept a state plea may have reflected genuine assessment that federal charges were harder to prove than they appeared. Prosecutors routinely make such calculations without facing public scrutiny.

2. **The OPR finding exonerates more than it condemns.** The Office of Professional Responsibility explicitly found no professional misconduct and no legal violations. "Poor judgment" is a lesser finding that acknowledges disagreement with the decision while stopping well short of finding it improper. Many prosecutorial decisions could be characterized as reflecting "poor judgment" in hindsight.

3. **The CVRA ruling was subsequently reversed.** The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, reversed Judge Marra's CVRA ruling in 2021. The appellate court found that CVRA rights do not attach until formal charges are filed. Because federal charges were never filed against Epstein, the appeals court held that no CVRA violation occurred. This reversal undermines claims that Acosta violated victims' legal rights.

4. **Acosta faced genuine prosecutorial challenges.** The 2008 case involved minors who might be reluctant to testify, potential impeachment issues, and a defendant with substantial legal resources. Acosta's stated concern that the state case alone might have resulted in less jail time reflects legitimate prosecutorial calculation.

5. **The 2019 indictment reflects different evidence, not the same case.** The SDNY charges against Epstein in 2019 may have been supported by evidence that was not available or not as developed in 2008. The Miami Herald's investigative journalism and additional victim cooperation in subsequent years may have strengthened the federal case in ways not possible a decade earlier.

6. **Political context may have influenced public perception.** Acosta's nomination to the Trump administration brought renewed scrutiny to a decade-old decision. Some criticism may have been politically motivated rather than based solely on the merits of the 2008 prosecutorial decision.

7. **The alternative to the NPA remains unknown.** Without the NPA, Epstein might have been acquitted at trial, fled prosecution, or received a lighter sentence in a state-only proceeding. Counterfactual arguments about what "should have" happened cannot be definitively resolved.
