**Regarding Jaffe's role:** In our assessment, Brett Jaffe appears in the documentary record as someone identified during discovery. The specific nature of his connection is not detailed in the documents reviewed.

**Regarding the Rule 26 disclosure:** Jaffe's inclusion in Maxwell's Rule 26 disclosures indicates the defense identified him as someone with potential knowledge relevant to the litigation. This is standard discovery practice.

**Regarding the absence of allegations:** We find no allegations against Brett Jaffe in the documentary record. His references appear to be for identification purposes during discovery.

**Our editorial judgment:** Brett Jaffe appears in the documentary record as someone identified during litigation. He is not accused of wrongdoing.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Jaffe was identified during standard discovery.** Rule 26 disclosures routinely identify individuals who may have relevant knowledge.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Jaffe.** He appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is limited.** Three mentions do not provide extensive detail about his role.

- **Privacy interests warrant careful treatment.** Individuals identified in discovery are not thereby implicated in underlying events.

- **Discovery identification is routine.** Both sides in litigation identify many persons who may have relevant information.

- **The specific relationship to the case is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
