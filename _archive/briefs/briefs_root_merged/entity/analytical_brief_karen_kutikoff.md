**Regarding Kutikoff's role:** In our assessment, Karen Kutikoff appears in the documentary record as someone identified during discovery. Her inclusion in Maxwell's Rule 26 disclosures indicates the defense identified her as someone with potential relevant knowledge.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Kutikoff was identified during standard discovery.** Rule 26 disclosures routinely identify individuals who may have relevant knowledge.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Kutikoff.** She appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record shows 5 references.** This suggests she was identified as potentially relevant to the litigation.

- **Privacy interests warrant careful treatment.** Individuals identified in discovery are not thereby implicated.

- **Discovery identification is routine.** Both sides in litigation identify persons who may have information.

- **The specific relationship to the case is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
