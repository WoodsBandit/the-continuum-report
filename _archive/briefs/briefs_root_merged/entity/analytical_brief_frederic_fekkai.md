- **New York social circles overlap.** Prominent figures in New York often know each other; this is not unusual.

- **No allegations exist against Fekkai.** He appears in documents without any claims of misconduct.

- **The documentary record is very limited.** Only two documents reference Fekkai, providing minimal context.

- **Celebrity names attract attention.** Recognizable names in litigation documents may receive disproportionate focus.
