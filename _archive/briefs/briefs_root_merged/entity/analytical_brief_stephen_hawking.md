## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist who passed away on March 14, 2018. His name appears in documents unsealed from the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation, primarily in connection with a 2006 scientific conference hosted by Jeffrey Epstein in the U.S. Virgin Islands. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Stephen Hawking, the celebrated physicist, appears in the Giuffre v. Maxwell documentary record in connection with a 2006 scientific conference hosted by Jeffrey Epstein on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Based on our review of the available court records, Hawking's name appears in the context of this event and related discussions. Hawking died in March 2018, before the 2019 federal charges against Epstein and before the 2024 document unsealing. He was never charged with any crime. The documentary record contains references to his attendance at the Epstein-hosted conference but no allegations of misconduct against Hawking. In our assessment, Hawking appears in these documents as one of several prominent scientists who attended Epstein-hosted events during the period when Epstein cultivated relationships with the scientific community.

### The 2006 Scientific Conference

According to public reporting and court document context, Jeffrey Epstein hosted a scientific conference on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2006. The conference, focused on gravity and related physics topics, was attended by several prominent scientists including Stephen Hawking.

Epstein was known to fund scientific research and host events bringing together prominent physicists, mathematicians, and other scientists. These activities were part of his broader strategy of cultivating relationships with prominent academics and intellectuals.

### Hawking's Death (March 2018)

Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018:
- Before Jeffrey Epstein's July 2019 federal arrest
- Before the document unsealing that brought discussion of the 2006 conference into public view
- Before any opportunity to address his name appearing in litigation documents

### Absence of Allegations

The court documents reviewed do not contain:
- Allegations that Stephen Hawking engaged in any misconduct
- Claims that Hawking participated in or knew of Epstein's criminal activities
- Testimony from any victim naming Hawking in connection with abuse
- Any accusation of wrongdoing against Hawking

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Hawking's documentary presence:** In our assessment, Stephen Hawking's appearance in these documents reflects Epstein's documented practice of hosting scientific conferences and cultivating relationships with prominent scientists. Hawking's attendance at the 2006 conference appears to have been in his capacity as a renowned physicist.

**Regarding Epstein's scientific philanthropy:** Epstein positioned himself as a supporter of scientific research, funding projects and hosting events that attracted prominent academics. Many scientists attended Epstein-hosted events without knowledge of his criminal activities, which were not publicly known at the time of the 2006 conference.

**Regarding the timing:** The 2006 conference occurred before Epstein's first prosecution became public. Scientists attending would not necessarily have had reason to suspect criminal conduct.

**Regarding the absence of allegations:** We find no allegations in the court records that Hawking was involved in any illegal activity or was aware of Epstein's crimes. His name appears in the context of a scientific event, not in connection with any accusation.

**Regarding Hawking's death:** Hawking died in 2018, before the renewed public attention to Epstein's activities following his 2019 arrest. He was never confronted with his name appearing in litigation documents and had no opportunity to provide context or response.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record shows Stephen Hawking attended a 2006 scientific conference hosted by Epstein. There are no allegations of misconduct against Hawking. His attendance appears to reflect Epstein's documented practice of hosting scientific events that attracted prominent researchers, rather than any improper relationship.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Attending a scientific conference does not establish wrongdoing.** Scientists regularly attend conferences hosted by various funders; attendance does not imply awareness of a host's other activities.

- **The 2006 timeline is significant.** The conference occurred before Epstein's criminal conduct was publicly known. Attendees would not have had reason to suspect the host of crimes.

- **Epstein's scientific philanthropy was extensive.** He funded numerous researchers and institutions, creating legitimate professional contexts for scientists to interact with him.

- **The absence of allegations against Hawking is significant.** No victim or witness accused Hawking of any misconduct in connection with Epstein.

- **Hawking's physical condition** would have limited his activities and made him dependent on caregivers for mobility and communication, providing context for his attendance at any event.

- **Hawking died before having any opportunity to respond** to his name appearing in documents, meaning only the documentary record—not Hawking's own account—is available.

- **Many prominent scientists attended Epstein events** during this period, reflecting Epstein's successful cultivation of the scientific community rather than individual scientists' complicity.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of 3 documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation that reference Stephen Hawking.

**What we did review:**
- Court filings in which Hawking's name appears
- Context of documentary mentions
- Public reporting on the 2006 conference

**What we did not review:**
- Any statements from Hawking or his estate
- Complete conference documentation
- Epstein's correspondence with scientists

**Critical limitations:**
- Hawking died before allegations became public discussion and could not respond
- The documentary record is limited to three references
- Conference context comes partly from public reporting, not solely court documents

**Important note:** Stephen Hawking was never charged with any crime and is not the subject of any known allegations related to Epstein. His appearance in these documents reflects attendance at a scientific conference, not any accusation of wrongdoing.
