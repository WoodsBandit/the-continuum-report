# WEXNER DOCUMENT GAP ANALYSIS — COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW
## The Continuum Report — Deep Source Review

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Tower)
**Documents Reviewed:** 2 (21 pages total)
**Status:** CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Deep review of Wexner source documents reveals **significant verification gaps** across multiple categories. Both documents are **self-serving institutional reports** with limited independent corroboration. The Kegler Brown independent review (Feb 2020) examined "thousands of pages" but cites ZERO primary source documents accessible to independent journalists.

**Critical Finding:** The review's central claims (misappropriation, power of attorney scope, property transfers) rest entirely on:
1. Wexner family interviews
2. IRS Form 990-PFs (which confirm money flows but not their characterization)
3. Ohio corporate records (formation documents only)

**Missing:** Court filings, banking records, property deeds, contemporaneous contracts, emails from Epstein era, and ANY documents showing the alleged "misappropriation" or recovery.

---

## POWER OF ATTORNEY DOCUMENTS

**Critical Gap:** The review mentions power of attorney FIVE times but produces ZERO documents.

**What Should Exist:**

1. **Power of Attorney Agreement** (Wexner to Epstein)
   - Date executed: Between mid-1980s and early 1990s
   - Scope: "Wide latitude to act on my behalf with respect to my personal finances"
   - Duration: Until 2007
   - Termination: How/when was it revoked?
   - **Form:** General POA, Durable POA, or Limited POA?

2. **Revocation of Power of Attorney** (Sept 2007)
   - Was it formally revoked?
   - Recorded where?
   - Notice to third parties?

**Where to Look:**

- **Ohio County Recorder's Office** (Franklin County - New Albany)
  - Powers of attorney sometimes recorded for real property transactions

- **New York County Clerk** (Manhattan)
  - If POA used for NYC property (9 E. 71st)

- **Banking institutions**
  - Banks holding Wexner accounts would require POA on file
  - Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan (if Epstein banked there on Wexner's behalf)

- **Brokerage accounts**
  - If Epstein traded securities for Wexner, POA required

- **Litigation discovery**
  - Estate of Epstein litigation
  - If Wexner sued Epstein for misappropriation, POA would be Exhibit A
  - **STATUS: No evidence Wexner ever sued Epstein**

**Red Flag:** Review says Wexner discovered "misappropriation" in 2007, but no lawsuit filed, no criminal complaint, no public record of legal action. Only evidence is Epstein's entities transferring $46M to Wexner family charity in 2008.

---

   - How did $10M from Wexner Charitable Fund transfer in 2003?
   - Bank statements showing Apple stock from FTC (2008)

4. **FTC Bank/Brokerage Records**
   - How did FTC acquire 201,939 shares of Apple stock?
   - When purchased?
   - From what funds?

## IRS FORM 990-PF ACQUISITION PLAN

## LEAKED EMAILS / DROPSITE NEWS (2025)

**Critical Reference in index.md:**

> "Contradicting Evidence:
> - 2025 leaked emails (Dropsite News) show Epstein relationship continued past 2007
> - Emails show Epstein functioned as de facto CFO with approval over major decisions"

**STATUS: NOT IN COLLECTION**

### What We Need:

1. **Dropsite News article(s)** - 2025
   - Publication dates
   - Authors
   - Full text

2. **Leaked emails - full set**
   - Dates (should include post-Sept 2007 if contradicting severance claim)
   - Parties (Wexner, Epstein, Foundation staff, others)
   - Subject matter
   - Authenticity verification

3. **Leak source**
   - Where did emails come from?
   - Estate proceedings?
   - Litigation discovery?
   - Hacked/leaked by third party?

**Search Strategy:**
- Google: "Dropsite News" + "Wexner" + "Epstein" + "2025"
- Dropsite News website: dropsiteNews.com (if exists)
- Twitter/X: Search @dropsiteNews or relevant journalists
- Archive.org: If articles deleted/scrubbed

**Why Critical:**
This is the ONLY cited contradictory evidence to Wexner's "immediately severed ties" claim. If emails show post-2007 contact, entire narrative collapses.

---

---

## FINANCIAL FORENSICS - TRANSACTION DOCUMENTATION

### The $46M Transfer (Jan 2008):

**What We Need to Reconstruct the Money Flow:**

1. **COUQ to YLK Transfer - $12,377,844** (Jan 1, 2008)
   - Wire transfer documentation
   - Source bank, receiving bank
   - Transfer memo/purpose

2. **FTC to YLK Transfer - 201,939 Apple shares** (Jan 2008)
   - Stock transfer records
   - DTC (Depository Trust Company) records
   - Valuation date: Jan 2008 (review says $34,280,154 book value)
   - Apple stock price Jan 2008: ~$170-200/share (pre-split) → 201,939 shares × $170 = $34.3M ✓

3. **Source of Apple Stock**
   - When did FTC acquire 201,939 Apple shares?
   - Purchase price?
   - If purchased with Wexner funds (as claimed), transaction records?

### The "Misappropriation" (pre-2007):

4. **Wexner Children's Trust to COUQ - $11M+ in stock** (2001)
   - Stock transfer records
   - What stock? (likely L Brands stock, but unspecified)
   - Authorization: Who approved? Epstein via POA?
   - **Red Flag:** Review says Wexners "never knew about or authorized" this transfer
   - **Counter-evidence needed:** If unauthorized, who DID authorize? Bank records would show.

5. **Leslie H. Wexner Charitable Fund to COUQ - $10M** (2003)
   - Transfer records
   - Who authorized charitable fund grants? (Answer: Trustees, likely including Epstein)
   - Was this a legitimate grant or misappropriation?
   - **Contradiction:** If Epstein was trustee of both entities, how is this "misappropriation"?

### YLK Distributions (2008-2010):

6. **YLK to "Other Charities"** - Amount unknown
   - Which charities?
   - How much to each?
   - YLK 990-PFs would list (Schedule of grants made)

7. **YLK to Wexner Family Charitable Fund - ~$35M** (Dec 2010)
   - Transfer documentation
   - Asset composition (Apple stock? Cash? Other?)

---

## VERIFICATION OF "NO CONTRIBUTIONS TO FOUNDATION" CLAIM

Review claims (p. 12): "Epstein made NO financial contributions to the Foundation"

**How to Verify:**

1. **Complete set of Wexner Foundation 990-PFs** (1991-2018)
   - Part VII-A: Lists all contributors of $5,000+
   - Search every year for: Epstein, COUQ, FTC, Epstein Interests

2. **Cash receipts records** (if accessible)
   - Foundation accounting records
   - Deposit records

3. **In-kind contributions**
   - Did Epstein donate services, property, other non-cash?
   - Should appear on 990-PF Schedule B

**Exception Noted:**
- 2001: Arts Interests Trust c/o Jeffrey Epstein - $9,588,560
- Review explains: Wexner's trust, Epstein just trustee
- **Verify:** Trust agreement (dated July 30, 1991) should confirm

---

## EPSTEIN'S OTHER WEALTHY CLIENTS (For Context)

Epstein claimed to manage money for billionaires. If Wexner was primary/only client:

**Documents to Search:**

1. **Epstein's Financial Management Business**
   - Corporate registrations (what entity? Financial Trust Company?)
   - SEC registration as investment advisor? (Search SEC IAPD database)
   - **If NOT registered:** Operating illegally as unregistered advisor

2. **Other Client Identities**
   - Epstein claimed to only work with billionaires
   - Who else? (Names from depositions, media reports)
   - If Wexner was ONLY client, changes nature of relationship

3. **Consulting Agreements**
   - Did Wexner pay Epstein fees?
   - Or pure POA arrangement?
   - Tax records: Did Epstein report income from Wexner?

---

## CLAIMS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION - PRIORITIZED

### CRITICAL TIER (Essential to Verify Core Claims):

**These documents are ESSENTIAL to verify the central narrative. Without them, claims rest on uncorroborated statements.**

#### C1. Power of Attorney Agreement (Wexner to Epstein)
- **Claim:** Epstein given "wide latitude" over Wexner's personal finances
- **Current Evidence:** Wexner's statement only
- **Where to Find:**
  - Franklin County, OH Recorder (if recorded)
  - Manhattan County Clerk (if used for NYC property)
  - Banking institutions (required to have on file)
  - Litigation files (if Wexner sued Epstein - NO EVIDENCE HE DID)
- **URL:** https://fcrpa.org (Franklin County Recorder, OH)
- **URL:** https://a836-acris.nyc.gov (NYC property records)
- **Why Critical:** Entire relationship's legal foundation. Scope determines what Epstein could/couldn't do.

#### C2. NYC Property Deed - 9 East 71st Street (Wexner to Epstein)
- **Claim:** Wexner owned property, transferred to Epstein (timing/terms unclear)
- **Current Evidence:** Public knowledge Epstein owned it; unknown how acquired
- **Where to Find:** NYC ACRIS (Automated City Register Information System)
- **URL:** https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/
- **Search:** Property address: 9 East 71st Street, Manhattan
- **What It Will Show:**
  - Date of transfer
  - Transfer type (sale, gift, trust)
  - Purchase price (if sale)
  - Mortgage/liens
- **Why Critical:** $50M+ property transfer. If gift, IRS implications. If sale, at what price? Market value or nominal? Core test of Wexner's claims about relationship.

#### C3. Evidence of "Misappropriation" and Recovery
- **Claim:** Epstein "misappropriated vast sums," Wexner "recovered some funds"
- **Current Evidence:** NONE. Only Wexner's word + $46M transfer from Epstein entities
- **What Should Exist:**
  - **Lawsuit:** Wexner v. Epstein (civil complaint for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty)
  - **Criminal complaint:** Report to FBI, Ohio police, or NY prosecutors
  - **Settlement agreement:** If settled out of court
  - **Demand letter:** From Wexner's attorneys to Epstein
  - **Financial audit:** Forensic accounting showing missing funds
- **Where to Search:**
  - PACER (federal courts): Any Wexner v. Epstein case
  - Ohio state courts (Franklin County): Civil and criminal dockets
  - New York state courts (Manhattan): Civil and criminal dockets
  - FBI FOIA: Any Wexner complaint about Epstein (pre-2007)
- **URL:** https://pacer.uscourts.gov
- **URL:** https://fcdcfcjs.co.franklin.oh.us (Franklin County, OH courts)
- **Why Critical:** If misappropriation occurred, WHY NO LEGAL ACTION? Normal response to theft is lawsuit/criminal complaint. Absence of legal action raises questions about narrative.

#### C4. Leaked Emails (Dropsite News, 2025)
- **Claim (from index.md):** "2025 leaked emails show Epstein relationship continued past 2007"
- **Current Evidence:** NOT IN COLLECTION
- **Where to Find:**
  - Dropsite News website
  - News aggregators
  - Twitter/X archives
  - Archive.org
- **Search Terms:** "Dropsite News" + "Wexner" + "Epstein" + "leaked emails"
- **Why Critical:** ONLY cited evidence contradicting Wexner's "immediately severed ties" claim. If emails show post-2007 contact, undermines entire August 2019 letter.

#### C5. IRS Form 990-PFs - Complete Set (88 forms)
- **Claim:** Financial flows as described in Kegler Brown review
- **Current Evidence:** Review cites them but doesn't produce them
- **Entities/Years Needed:**
  1. Wexner Foundation (1991-2018): 28 forms
  2. Wexner Family Charitable Fund (2001-2018): 18 forms
  3. YLK Charitable Fund (2008-2010): 3 forms
  4. C.O.U.Q. Foundation (2001-2012): 12 forms
  5. Epstein Interests, Inc. (2001-2012): 12 forms
  6. Wexner Heritage Foundation (1991-2005): 15 forms
- **Where to Find:**
  - **ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer:** https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits
  - **Foundation Center (Candid):** https://candid.org (subscription)
  - **IRS:** Form 4506-A request ($1/page)
  - **Ohio AG Charitable Law:** https://ohioattorneygeneral.gov/charities
- **Why Critical:** These are PUBLIC documents that form the factual basis for the review's financial claims. Without them, we're accepting law firm's summary without verification.

#### C6. Maria Farmer - FBI Interview Records (2019)
- **Claim:** Farmer reported 1996 assault at Wexner's Ohio estate
- **Current Evidence:** Media interviews (The Cut, others)
- **What to Obtain:**
  - FBI 302 reports (witness interview summaries)
  - Any affidavits filed in court
  - Victim compensation fund claims
  - Police reports (New Albany, OH)
- **Where to Find:**
  - **FOIA Request to FBI:** https://vault.fbi.gov/foia-request
  - **New Albany Police Dept:** https://www.newalbanyohio.org/police
  - **Court records:** Any Farmer v. Epstein Estate filings
- **Why Critical:** ONLY direct allegation of crime at Wexner property. Tests Wexner's claim of no knowledge of Epstein's activities. If assault occurred at his home (1996), when Epstein was Foundation trustee (1992-2007), claim of ignorance is harder to sustain.

#### C7. L Brands SEC Filings Mentioning Epstein (2019)
- **Claim:** Public company disclosure obligations
- **Current Evidence:** Unknown if filings mention Epstein
- **What to Search:**
  - Form 8-K (Current Reports): July-Sept 2019 (after Epstein arrest)
  - Form 10-K (Annual Reports): 2019, 2020
  - DEF 14A (Proxy Statements): 2020, 2021
  - Any amendments or special disclosures
- **Where to Find:** https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch
- **Search:** "L Brands" OR "Bath & Body Works" (CIK: 0001029562)
- **Why Critical:** Public companies must disclose material events and related party transactions. If Wexner's relationship with Epstein was as described (decades-long, POA over personal finances, $46M in transfers), might require disclosure. Absence of disclosure also meaningful.

- **Documents Needed:**

  - **Court records:** "Unrelated court records" mentioned in review - which case?
- **Why Important:** If FTC was Epstein's entity that somehow held $34M in Apple stock, how did it acquire that stock? If from Wexner funds, that's the "misappropriation." Need documentation.

- **Claim:** Wexner created charitable remainder trust, Epstein served as trustee, Foundation was beneficiary
- **Current Evidence:** Review cites trust agreement, examined but not produced
- **Documents Needed:**
  - Full trust agreement
  - Amendments
  - Termination/distribution documentation (2001)

  - **Purpose:** To receive $46M from Epstein entities (Jan 2008)
  - **Question:** Was YLK created specifically to receive Epstein's payment? Suggests pre-arranged settlement.

- **Case:** State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein (Palm Beach County)
- **Documents:**
  - Plea agreement
  - Non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with federal prosecutors

  - **Wexner's Sept 2007 severance:** Just before federal NPA finalized
  - **Question:** Did Wexner sever ties because of impending charges? Not "discovery of misappropriation"?

- **Documents Needed:**

- **Why Important:** Public company governance requires disclosure of related party transactions exceeding $120,000. If Epstein was paid from L Brands, should appear here.

#### H10. Kegler Brown Engagement Letter / Scope of Work
- **Claim:** Independent review
- **Questions:**
  - Who hired Kegler Brown? (Wexner Foundation - the client)
  - What was scope? (Appears limited to Foundation, not Wexner personally)
  - Were there constraints? (Review notes email archives "don't go back" to Epstein era)
  - Fee arrangement?
- **Where to Find:**
  - Unlikely to be public
  - Might be disclosed in Foundation 990-PF (professional fees)
- **Why Important:** Helps assess independence. Client was Foundation (funded by Wexner), not truly independent investigator.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Context and Background):

**These documents provide helpful context but are less essential to verifying core claims.**

#### M1. "Friends Who Vouched for Epstein" (mid-1980s)
- **Claim:** Wexner met Epstein "through friends who vouched for and recommended him"
- **Current Evidence:** Wexner's statement only; friends NOT named
- **Potential Sources:**
  - **Ace Greenberg** - Bear Stearns CEO; Epstein's employer (1976-1981)
  - **Steven Hoffenberg** - Towers Financial; worked with Epstein
  - **Isabel Maxwell** - Ghislaine's sister; early Epstein connection
  - Others in NYC finance/social circles
- **Documents:**
  - Contemporaneous correspondence (1980s)
  - Introduction letters
  - Social event records
- **Why Useful:** Establishes how relationship began. Who vouched for Epstein? Were they deceived too, or complicit?

#### M2. Epstein's Employment History (Pre-Wexner)
- **Claim:** Epstein represented himself as "financial professional" with prominent clients
- **Timeline:**
  - 1976-1981: Bear Stearns (options trader)
  - 1982-?: Started own financial management business
  - Mid-1980s: Met Wexner
- **Documents:**
  - Bear Stearns employment records
  - SEC Series 7 license? (stockbroker)
  - SEC RIA registration? (investment advisor)
  - Client list (pre-Wexner)
- **Where to Find:**
  - **FINRA BrokerCheck:** https://brokercheck.finra.org
  - **SEC IAPD:** https://adviserinfo.sec.gov
- **Why Useful:** Verifies Epstein's credentials (or lack thereof). Was he legitimately qualified to manage billionaire's money?

#### M3. Wexner's Other Professional Advisors (1980s-2007)
- **Question:** Did Wexner have other financial advisors besides Epstein?
- **Potential Sources:**
  - Accountants (who prepared Wexner's tax returns?)
  - Estate planning attorneys
  - Investment advisors
  - Board of directors (L Brands) - any oversight of CEO's personal finances?
- **Why Useful:** Context for Epstein's role. Was he sole advisor (unusual) or one of many?

#### M4. Epstein's USVI Properties - Purchase Documents
- **Properties:**
  - Little St. James (purchased 1998, $7.95M)
  - Great St. James (purchased 2016, $18M)
- **Documents:**
  - Deeds
  - Mortgage records
  - Source of funds
- **Where to Find:** USVI Recorder of Deeds
- **Why Useful:** If purchased 1998 with Wexner money (during POA period), supports misappropriation claim.

#### M5. Epstein's Wealth Estimates - Forbes, Bloomberg
- **Claim:** Epstein claimed to be billionaire money manager
- **Evidence:**
  - No Forbes 400 listing
  - No public track record managing others' money
  - Wealth sources opaque
- **Documents:**
  - Financial press profiles (Vanity Fair 2003, others)
  - Wealth estimates
  - Known assets at death (estate inventory)
- **Where to Find:**
  - Estate of Jeffrey Epstein probate filings (USVI)
  - Financial press archives
- **Why Useful:** Helps assess if Wexner was truly his only major client. If so, entire "billionaire money manager" persona was Wexner-funded.

#### M6. Wexner's Public Statements Timeline
- **Statements:**
  - August 8, 2019: Letter to Foundation community (Document 1)
  - Other public statements? (Press releases, interviews)
- **Question:** Did Wexner make ANY public statements about Epstein before Aug 2019 letter?
- **Search:**
  - L Brands press releases
  - News archives
  - Wexner speeches/interviews
- **Why Useful:** Silence before 2019 is notable. When did Wexner first publicly address relationship?

#### M7. Epstein's Charitable Giving (COUQ Foundation Grants)
- **Source:** COUQ 990-PFs (2001-2012)
- **What to Extract:**
  - Which charities received grants?
  - Amounts?
  - Any pattern? (Wexner-related charities? Jewish causes?)
- **Where to Find:** COUQ 990-PFs Schedule of grants made
- **Why Useful:** Shows how Epstein used his foundation. If mostly Wexner money, did grants align with Wexner's interests?

#### M8. Epstein's Tax Returns (If Accessible)
- **Source:** Private, but may exist in litigation discovery
- **What They'd Show:**
  - Income sources
  - Payments from Wexner/L Brands
  - Capital gains (if sold assets)
  - Charitable deductions
- **Where to Find:**
  - Estate of Epstein litigation
  - IRS FOIA (denied for privacy, but estate is public)
- **Why Useful:** Would definitively show if Wexner paid Epstein fees, or if relationship was pure POA.

#### M9. Wexner Family Charitable Fund - Grant History
- **Source:** 990-PFs (2001-2018)
- **What to Extract:**
  - ALL grants made (not just to Wexner Foundation)
  - Patterns in giving
  - Other beneficiaries
- **Why Useful:** Shows Wexner Foundation is just one of many recipients. Helps assess importance of YLK money (review says it wasn't necessary).

#### M10. Insurance Records (Wexner's D&O, Personal Liability)
- **Potential Coverage:**
  - Directors & Officers insurance (L Brands)
  - Personal liability (for POA arrangements)
  - Fidelity bond (covering employee theft)
- **Question:** Did any insurance cover Epstein's alleged misappropriation?
- **Where to Find:** Unlikely to be public; might be in L Brands SEC filings (material contracts)
- **Why Useful:** If insurance paid out for Epstein's theft, there'd be documentation.

---

## RED FLAGS / UNRESOLVED CONTRADICTIONS

### 1. NO LEGAL ACTION FOR "MISAPPROPRIATION"

**Problem:** Wexner claims Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money"
- Normal response: Civil lawsuit (fraud, breach of fiduciary duty)
- OR: Criminal complaint to police/FBI
- **Evidence of legal action:** NONE

**Explanation offered:** $46M transfer from Epstein entities to YLK = partial restitution
- **Counter-question:** Why accept private settlement instead of suing?
- If funds were stolen, why not pursue full recovery + damages?

**Possible interpretations:**
1. Misappropriation claim is true, but Wexner wanted to avoid publicity
2. Transfers to COUQ/FTC were authorized, narrative of "misappropriation" created later
3. $46M was payment for services rendered (not return of stolen funds)

### 2. WEXNER CLAIMS HE "NEVER KNEW" ABOUT COUQ TRANSFERS (2001, 2003)

**The Transfers:**
- 2001: $11M+ from Wexner Children's Trust → COUQ
- 2003: $10M from Leslie H. Wexner Charitable Fund → COUQ

**Wexner's Claim (Kegler Brown interview):** "Never knew about or authorized" these transfers

**Problem:**
- If Epstein had POA, he MAY have had authority (depends on POA scope)
- If Epstein was trustee of both entities, transfers were authorized (by himself as trustee)
- How can $21M transfer without owner's knowledge?

**Banking Reality:**
- Banks don't transfer $21M without authorization
- Transfer requires:
  - Authorized signer (Epstein via POA?)
  - Trustee approval (if from trust)
  - Board approval (if from charitable fund)

**Red Flag:** If transfers were unauthorized, banks would be liable. No evidence Wexner sued banks for allowing fraudulent transfers.

### 3. TIMING OF YLK CREATION (Dec 20, 2007)

**Timeline:**
- Sept 4, 2007: Epstein resigns all Wexner roles
- Dec 20, 2007: Abigail Wexner creates YLK (11 weeks later)
- Jan 1, 2008: COUQ transfers $12M to YLK (12 days later)
- Jan 2008: FTC transfers $34M in Apple stock to YLK

**Red Flag:** YLK created JUST BEFORE receiving $46M from Epstein entities

**Implication:** This appears pre-arranged. YLK wasn't an existing charity that happened to receive money - it was created specifically to receive it.

**Question:** If this was restitution for theft, why create NEW entity? Why not return directly to Wexner accounts or existing Wexner Family Charitable Fund?

### 4. FOUNDATION EMAILS "DON'T GO BACK" TO EPSTEIN ERA

**Kegler Brown (p. 2):**
> "Foundation's archive of emails does not go back to Epstein's time as Trustee"

**Problem:** Epstein resigned Sept 2007 - only 12 years before review (Feb 2020)

**Standard email retention:**
- Nonprofits typically retain 7-10 years
- Legal holds preserve emails for litigation
- Epstein was in news since 2008 Florida case

**Question:** Why don't emails exist?
1. Never archived (poor records management)
2. Deleted before Epstein scandal (routine purge)
3. Deleted after scandal (spoliation?)

**Red Flag:** Convenient absence of potentially damaging emails

### 5. EPSTEIN "NEVER HAD FOUNDATION EMAIL ADDRESS"

**Kegler Brown (p. 2):**
> "Epstein never had a Foundation email address"

**But:**
- Epstein was Trustee for 15 years (1992-2007)
- Foundation email system presumably established in late 1990s
- Other trustees had Foundation email?

**Implication:** Epstein truly had no operational role (supports Foundation's narrative)
OR: Epstein used personal email, leaving no foundation archive (convenient)

### 6. "WIDE LATITUDE" POA WITH NO DOCUMENTATION

**Wexner's claim:** Epstein had power of attorney with "wide latitude to act on my behalf with respect to my personal finances"

**Problem:** No POA document produced

**Legal reality:**
- Banks require POA on file to honor
- Real estate transfers require POA
- Investment accounts require POA
- These documents are KEPT by institutions

**Question:** If POA existed, why not produce it in review? Would definitively show scope of authority.

### 7. LEAKED EMAILS CONTRADICTION (2025 Dropsite News)

**Index.md reference:**
> "2025 leaked emails (Dropsite News) show Epstein relationship continued past 2007"
> "Emails show Epstein functioned as de facto CFO with approval over major decisions"

**Problem:** Directly contradicts Wexner's "immediately severed ties" claim

**Status:** Emails NOT in current collection

**Critical gap:** This is the ONLY cited contradictory evidence. Must obtain.

### 8. THE $100,000 EPSTEIN CONTRIBUTION TO COUQ (2007)

**Kegler Brown (p. 15):**
> "The only other contribution made to COUQ... was $100,000 contributed by Epstein, which is reflected on COUQ's Form 990-PF for 2007"

**Context:**
- COUQ funded almost entirely by Wexner money ($21M+)
- Epstein contributes $100K (0.5% of total)
- Fiscal year ending Feb 28, 2008 - can't tell if before or after $46M transfer (Jan 2008)

**Question:** Why did Epstein contribute $100K to a foundation he was supposedly returning stolen money through?

**Possible interpretations:**
1. Token contribution to maintain appearance it was "his" foundation
2. Contribution made AFTER Jan 2008 transfer, unrelated
3. Some legitimate charitable intent

### 9. APPLE STOCK VALUATION CONFIRMS TIMING

**FTC Transfer (Jan 2008):** 201,939 shares of Apple Inc.

**Math check:**
- Review states book value: $34,280,154
- $34,280,154 ÷ 201,939 shares = $169.78/share

**Apple stock price Jan 2008:** $~180-200/share (pre-split)

**Confirms:** Transfer occurred January 2008 as claimed

**Question:** How did Epstein's FTC acquire 201,939 Apple shares?
- If purchased with Wexner money (the "misappropriation"), when?
- If purchased legitimately, with what funds?
- Apple 2008 shares would have been worth much more if held from earlier (stock split 7:1 in 2014)

### 10. INDEPENDENT REVIEW CLIENT IS WEXNER FOUNDATION

**Kegler Brown engagement:**
- Client: Wexner Foundation
- Funded by: Wexner family (~90%)
- Governing board: Includes Leslie and Abigail Wexner

**Problem:** Not truly independent investigation

**What's missing:**
- Outside special counsel appointed by court
- Investigation triggered by law enforcement
- Independent forensic audit by hostile party

**Reality:** This is a client-funded report designed to reassure Foundation donors. Not a adversarial investigation.

## CLAIMS LACKING ANY CORROBORATION

### Claims Resting SOLELY on Wexner's Word:

1. "Friends vouched for Epstein" (mid-1980s) - friends NOT named
2. Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money" - no lawsuit, no documentation
3. "We were able to recover some of the funds" - only evidence is $46M transfer
4. "Immediately severed ties" - contradicted by 2025 leaked emails
5. POA scope: "wide latitude" - no POA document produced
6. Wexner "never knew about or authorized" $21M in transfers to COUQ
7. All money in COUQ/FTC was "originally Wexner family money"

11. FTC transferred $34M in Apple stock to YLK (2008)
12. YLK dissolved and transferred ~$35M to Wexner Family Charitable Fund (2010)

**Note:** 990-PFs confirm money flows, but NOT their characterization (gift vs. theft vs. authorized transfer)

### Claims with NO Evidence at All:

13. Epstein had "well-known and respected individuals" as other clients - NOT named
14. Epstein "vehemently denied" Florida allegations (to Wexner) - no documentation
15. Foundation staff "never saw Epstein in offices" - based on interviews, no records

## CONCLUSION

### Documents Reviewed:
- 2 documents (21 pages)
- 1 public statement (self-serving)
- 1 client-funded legal review (limited independence)

### Documents Referenced But Not Produced:
- Thousands of pages cited, ZERO provided for independent verification
- 88 IRS 990-PFs (public documents, should be obtainable)
- Power of attorney (critical, may not be publicly accessible)
- NYC property deed (public, readily obtainable)
- Court filings (public, PACER accessible)

### Critical Gaps:
1. **NO EVIDENCE** of claimed "misappropriation" beyond Wexner's word
2. **NO LEGAL ACTION** taken against Epstein for alleged theft
3. **MISSING EMAILS** from Epstein era (convenient absence)
4. **NO POWER OF ATTORNEY** produced despite being central to relationship
5. **CONTRADICTORY LEAKED EMAILS** referenced but not in collection

### Verification Status:
- **UNVERIFIABLE:** Primary claims rest on Wexner interviews only
- **PARTIALLY VERIFIABLE:** Money flows can be traced via 990-PFs (need to obtain)
- **CONTRADICTED:** 2025 leaked emails reportedly undermine severance timeline
- **SUSPICIOUS:** Timing of YLK creation, absence of litigation, missing emails

### Recommended Action:
**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Acquire the 7 CRITICAL-tier documents, especially:
1. NYC property deed (free, confirms $50M+ property transfer)
2. 990-PFs for COUQ, YLK, Wexner entities (public, under $300)
3. Dropsite News leaked emails (public but not located)
4. Maria Farmer FBI records (FOIA, free)

These four categories would provide INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION or CONTRADICTION of Wexner's narrative.

**CURRENT STATUS:** The existing Wexner documents are **INSUFFICIENT** to verify key claims. An independent journalist relying solely on these documents would be repeating Wexner's self-serving narrative without corroboration.
