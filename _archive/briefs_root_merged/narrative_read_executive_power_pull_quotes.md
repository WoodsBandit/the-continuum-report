## Tier 1 — Hero Quotes (Highest Impact)

### The Anchor Line
> **The tea was three percent. What percentage are you paying now?**

### The Thesis
> **This is not conspiracy. It's documented history. Every step is recorded in court decisions, congressional acts, and executive orders. The receipts are available to anyone who cares to read them.**

### The Mechanism

## Tier 2 — Section Pull Quotes

### On the 1895 Decision
> **Americans in 1895 could look at their Constitution and see a document that protected them from federal income taxation. The Supreme Court had confirmed it. Remember how it felt to have constitutional limits that actually limited.**

### On 1913
> **Thirty-nine words. They removed the structural barrier that had stood for 124 years.**

### On the Pujo Committee Irony
> **An investigation exposed that too much financial power was concentrated in too few hands. The solution was to create a new institution with enormous financial power.**

### On Gold Confiscation
> **The "emergency" that justified gold confiscation began in 1933. Americans were not permitted to own gold again until 1974 — forty-one years later. Forty-one years is not an emergency. Forty-one years is a policy.**

### On the Emergency Banking Act
> **A wartime emergency power had just become a peacetime emergency power — activated whenever the President declared a national emergency.**

### On Nixon Shock
> **No vote. No constitutional amendment. Just done.**

### On Nixon (Extended)
> **If you had dutifully surrendered your gold in 1933, accepted paper dollars in exchange, trusted the government's promise that those dollars were "good as gold" — well, as of August 15, 1971, they weren't.**

### On the National Emergencies Act
> **The National Emergencies Act was supposed to limit emergencies — instead it codified them.**

### On Active Emergencies
> **How many national emergencies are in effect right now? Over forty. Some date back decades.**

### On Chevron Deference
> **Congress passes an ambiguous statute. The agency interprets it broadly. The court defers. Power expands.**

### On the Administrative State
> **Agencies now write rules, enforce rules, and judge violations of rules.**

### On the Surveillance Transformation
> **The government that couldn't tax income in 1895 now monitors your communications.**

### On Bipartisanship
> **Democrats and Republicans alike have expanded executive power when they held it and complained about executive power when they didn't. The names change. The direction doesn't.**
