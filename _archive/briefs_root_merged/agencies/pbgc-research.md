## 5. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES

### Multiemployer Crisis (Pre-ARP)
- Prior to ARP: Multiemployer Program projected insolvent by FY2026
- FY2019: Record deficit of $65.2 billion in multiemployer program
- Many plans critically underfunded (demographics, investment losses, structural issues)

### American Rescue Plan Rescue (2021)
- **$97 billion bailout** prevented immediate pension benefit cuts
- Extended solvency projection: FY2026 → beyond 2062 (40+ years)
- **Dependency Concerns:** Post-ARP, plans increased exposure to riskier assets (stocks, private equity) by $32.5 billion while reducing cash/debt holdings
- Critics characterize as "near-term plug" not addressing long-term structural problems

### Benefit Limits & Reductions
- Single-employer maximum remains below promised benefits in many failed plans
- Multiemployer guarantee limits extremely modest ($35.75/month per year of service)
- Participants in failed plans typically receive reduced benefits vs. original promises

### Historical Underfunding Crises
- **Early 1990s recession:** PBGC accumulated $2.9 billion deficit (20 large plan takeovers)
- **2003:** Combined deficits of $11.5 billion across both programs
- **2011:** Record $26 billion deficit (largest in 37-year history)
- **Root cause:** Premium levels set by Congress never high enough to cover systemic risks

### Structural Issues
- Three underlying factors:
  1. Inadequate premium levels
  2. Inadequate funding rules
  3. Exposure to macroeconomic risks
- Potential single-employer exposure: $227 billion in underfunding (FY2010)
- Legislative reforms (Retirement Protection Act 1994, Pension Protection Act 2006) tightened rules but didn't eliminate exposure
