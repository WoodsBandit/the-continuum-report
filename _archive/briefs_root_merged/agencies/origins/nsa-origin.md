## CREATION OF NSA

### Predecessor Organizations
- **WWI-WWII Era:** Multiple cryptologic organizations

- Korean War exposed intelligence gaps

### Truman's Decision
- Classified directive creating NSA signed November 4, 1952
- Established as centralized agency under Department of Defense
- Broader authority over signals intelligence (SIGINT) than AFSA
- Superseded AFSA entirely
