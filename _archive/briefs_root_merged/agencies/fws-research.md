- ~420 positions slashed in March 2025
- 76 species under settlement review obligation
- At least 42 species went extinct while awaiting listing
- Pinyon jay (80% decline) delayed until FY2028

### Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)
- 1.5 million-acre Coastal Plain opened to drilling (2017)
- First lease sale (January 2021): 9 leases awarded
- Second lease sale (January 2025): Zero bids received
- FWS identified area as having greatest ecological diversity on Alaska's north slope
- Gwich'in opposition due to caribou herd impacts

### 2025 ESA Regulatory Changes
- Proposed rollback to 2019/2020 framework
- Four rules to narrow critical habitat definitions
- Allow economic factors in listing determinations
- H.R. 845 would weaken ESA protections significantly
