## Statement of Public Interest

Deutsche Bank maintained a banking relationship with Jeffrey Epstein from 2013 to 2018, after JP Morgan terminated its relationship with Epstein following his 2008 conviction. The New York State Department of Financial Services investigated Deutsche Bank's compliance failures and entered a Consent Order in July 2020 imposing a $150 million penalty. The Deutsche Bank relationship demonstrates that Epstein maintained access to major financial institutions even after his criminal conviction.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The Deutsche Bank case represents documented regulatory findings of compliance failures in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's accounts. Unlike the JP Morgan case (which involved allegations in civil litigation), the Deutsche Bank case resulted in a Consent Order with specific findings by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The regulator found that Deutsche Bank failed to properly monitor Epstein's accounts despite "red flags" including his prior criminal conviction and suspicious transaction patterns. The $150 million penalty and the specific findings in the Consent Order establish documented institutional failure to comply with anti-money laundering requirements.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented facts from regulatory findings and court records without editorial comment.*

### NYSDFS Consent Order (July 6, 2020)

The New York State Department of Financial Services entered a Consent Order with Deutsche Bank on July 6, 2020. As cited in the USVI v. JPMorgan complaint:

**Paragraph 71 of USVI Complaint:**

> "The New York State Department of Financial Services ('NYSDFS') investigated Deutsche Bank for failures to monitor Epstein's accounts. On July 6, 2020, the NYSDFS and Deutsche Bank entered into a Consent Order with a $150 million penalty."

### Specific Regulatory Findings

The NYSDFS Consent Order found:

**Account Monitoring Failures:**
- Deutsche Bank failed to adequately monitor Epstein's accounts despite his prior criminal conviction
- The bank did not properly investigate suspicious transaction patterns
- Red flags were not adequately addressed

**Paragraph 72 of USVI Complaint:**

> "The NYSDFS also found fault with Deutsche Bank's failure to obtain answers regarding Epstein's use of his accounts to pay women with Eastern European surnames."

**Compliance Program Deficiencies:**
The NYSDFS found that "ichungen occurred in the monitoring of a high-risk customer."

### Timeline of Deutsche Bank Relationship

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2008 | Epstein pleads guilty to Florida state charges |
| 2011 | JP Morgan terminates relationship with Epstein |
| 2013 | Deutsche Bank accepts Epstein as client |
| 2018 | Deutsche Bank terminates relationship with Epstein |
| 2019 | Epstein arrested on federal charges; dies in custody |
| July 2020 | NYSDFS Consent Order ($150 million penalty) |

### Settlement with USVI

Deutsche Bank separately settled claims brought by the U.S. Virgin Islands related to Epstein's activities in that jurisdiction. The settlement was part of broader civil recovery efforts following Epstein's death.

### Contrast with JP Morgan

The Deutsche Bank case differs from the JP Morgan case in several respects:
- Deutsche Bank accepted Epstein after JP Morgan terminated him
- Deutsche Bank's relationship was during a period when Epstein was a convicted sex offender
- The Deutsche Bank case resulted in a regulatory Consent Order with specific findings, not just civil litigation settlement

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the timing:** Deutsche Bank accepted Epstein as a client in 2013, two years after JP Morgan terminated its relationship with him and five years after his Florida conviction. This timeline suggests Deutsche Bank made a deliberate decision to bank a client another major institution had rejected and who had a public criminal record.

**Regarding the regulatory findings:** Unlike the JP Morgan case, which involved allegations in civil litigation settled without admission of liability, the Deutsche Bank case produced a Consent Order with specific regulatory findings. The NYSDFS found compliance failures as fact, not merely as allegations.

**Regarding the suspicious transactions:** The finding that Deutsche Bank failed to investigate payments to women with Eastern European surnames is significant. This pattern—documented by regulators, not merely alleged—suggests the bank processed transactions that should have triggered enhanced scrutiny.

**Regarding institutional responsibility:** In our assessment, the Deutsche Bank case demonstrates that major financial institutions continued providing banking services to Epstein even after his conviction. This raises questions about the effectiveness of compliance programs and the incentives facing financial institutions when serving wealthy clients.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Deutsche Bank Consent Order represents one of the most significant documented findings regarding financial institution involvement with Epstein. The regulatory findings establish compliance failures as determined by a government agency with examination authority, providing stronger evidentiary foundation than civil litigation allegations.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Industry-wide issues:** Deutsche Bank's compliance failures may reflect broader industry problems with anti-money laundering programs rather than Epstein-specific decisions.

- **Limited knowledge:** Bank personnel may not have had knowledge of Epstein's ongoing criminal activity despite awareness of his prior conviction.

- **Regulatory hindsight:** The regulatory action came after Epstein's 2019 arrest and death, when the full scope of his activities became public. Earlier compliance decisions were made with less information.

- **Remediation:** Deutsche Bank ultimately terminated the relationship in 2018 and cooperated with regulators, suggesting the compliance system eventually functioned.

- **Client diversity:** Large banks have thousands of clients; individual account monitoring has practical limitations.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
