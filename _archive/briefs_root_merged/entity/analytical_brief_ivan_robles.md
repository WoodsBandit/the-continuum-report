## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Robles was identified during standard discovery.** Discovery processes identify individuals who may have relevant knowledge.

- **The context suggests property-related work.** He may have been an employee or contractor.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Robles.** He appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is very limited.** Two mentions do not provide extensive detail about his role.

- **Many property staff appear in this litigation.** Such identification is routine when documenting household operations.

- **The specific nature of his role is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
