## Statement of Public Interest

Mar-a-Lago is a private club in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by Donald Trump since 1985. The property appears in court documents from the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* civil litigation as the location where Virginia Giuffre was working as a spa attendant when Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly approached and recruited her. The property's relevance to the documentary record lies solely in its role as the site of this alleged recruitment, not in any allegation against the property's owner or operators. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Mar-a-Lago appears in the Giuffre v. Maxwell documentary record as the location where Virginia Giuffre was employed when Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly recruited her into Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking operation. According to court filings, Giuffre was working at the club as a spa attendant (also described in some sources as a locker room attendant) when Maxwell approached her around 2000. In our assessment, the property appears in documents solely as a geographic location relevant to recruitment accounts. The documentary record does not contain allegations that Mar-a-Lago's ownership or management facilitated or had knowledge of Maxwell's alleged recruitment activities at the property. Donald Trump, the property's owner, appears separately in the litigation record with testimony establishing he visited Epstein's Palm Beach residence for meals but did not stay overnight.

- **Employment:** Working as a spa/locker room attendant
- **Age:** 16 years old at time of alleged recruitment
- **Alleged recruiter:** Ghislaine Maxwell
- **Year:** Approximately 2000

### Virginia Giuffre's Recruitment Account

**[ECF Doc. 1328-19](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-19.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Court filings contain accounts describing Giuffre's employment at Mar-a-Lago and Maxwell's approach:

> "She wrote that she was introduced to Epstein at the mansion by heiress Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late British publisher Robert Maxwell, on the pretext that she would be paid to give him a [massage]."

### Employment Context

**ECF Doc. 1320-37, filed 01/03/24:**

Court documents reference Mar-a-Lago as the location where Virginia Giuffre was employed at the time of her alleged recruitment. The documents indicate that Virginia's father, Robert Giuffre, also worked at the property.

**ECF Doc. 1320-40, filed 01/03/24** (Maxwell's Rule 26 Disclosures):

Mar-a-Lago is referenced in discovery materials as a relevant location in connection with the circumstances of Giuffre's recruitment.

**ECF Doc. 1328-42, filed 01/05/24, pp. 6:6-13** (Deposition of Juan Alessi, Epstein's former house manager):

Testimony from Epstein's house manager establishes that Donald Trump maintained social contact with Epstein consistent with both being Palm Beach residents:

> "Q. Now, Mr. Trump had a home in Palm Beach, correct?
> A. Uh-huh.
> Q. So he didn't come and stay there, did he?
> A. No, never.
> Q. He would come for a meal?
> A. He would come, have dinner. He never sat at the..."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Mar-a-Lago's role in the documentary record:** In our assessment, the property appears in court documents solely as a geographic location where a significant event in the Epstein case allegedly occurred. The recruitment of Virginia Giuffre, as she has described it across multiple proceedings, took place at this location while she was employed there.

**Regarding the property's status:** Mar-a-Lago is a private club that has been owned by Donald Trump since 1985. The property operates as a membership club and has hosted numerous events over decades. Its appearance in Epstein-related documents reflects the alleged recruitment location, not any allegation against the property itself or its operations.

**Regarding the absence of allegations against ownership:** We note that the documentary record from *Giuffre v. Maxwell* does not contain allegations that Mar-a-Lago's ownership or management participated in, facilitated, or had knowledge of Maxwell's alleged recruitment activities. The property appears as a setting, not as a party to alleged wrongdoing.

**Regarding geographic context:** Both Epstein and Trump maintained residences in Palm Beach during the relevant period. The documentary record shows social overlap consistent with prominent Palm Beach residents knowing each other. Testimony from Epstein's house manager explicitly establishes that Trump visited Epstein's property only for meals and did not stay overnight.

**Regarding the recruitment pattern:** Virginia Giuffre's account of being recruited while working a legitimate job at Mar-a-Lago is consistent with documented recruitment methods in the broader Epstein case. Multiple witnesses have described being approached through seemingly normal circumstances before being drawn into Epstein's operation.

**Our editorial judgment:** Mar-a-Lago's significance in the documentary record lies entirely in its role as the location where Virginia Giuffre was working when Maxwell allegedly approached her. The property functions in these documents as a setting for events, not as a subject of allegations. The documentary record does not suggest Mar-a-Lago's ownership or management was aware of or complicit in Maxwell's alleged recruitment activities.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Mar-a-Lago was an incidental location.** The property's appearance in documents reflects only that Giuffre happened to work there when Maxwell allegedly approached her. The recruitment could have occurred at any location where Giuffre was employed.

2. **The property's prominence explains the attention.** Mar-a-Lago's significance may be amplified in public discourse due to its ownership by a former president, even though the documentary record does not implicate the property or its owner in the alleged conduct.

3. **The documentary record establishes no wrongdoing by the property.** No court document in the analyzed set alleges that Mar-a-Lago's operations, ownership, or management facilitated Maxwell's alleged recruitment activities.

4. **Employment at Mar-a-Lago provided access.** Maxwell's access to Giuffre was through the property where Giuffre worked; however, this reflects Maxwell's alleged predatory behavior in seeking out young workers, not any failure by the employer.

5. **The setting does not establish employer knowledge.** An employee being approached by a third party on employer premises does not, by itself, establish that the employer knew or should have known of the third party's intentions.

6. **Other recruitment locations exist in the record.** The Epstein documentary record describes recruitment occurring at multiple locations, including Epstein's residences, colleges, and other venues. Mar-a-Lago is one of several documented recruitment settings.

7. **Public interest in this location may reflect political factors.** Given the property owner's political prominence, the attention to Mar-a-Lago's mention in documents may exceed what the documentary record itself would warrant.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
