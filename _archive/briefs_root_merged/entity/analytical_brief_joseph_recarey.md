## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Joseph Recarey was the lead Palm Beach Police detective who investigated Jeffrey Epstein. His deposition testimony is referenced in court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation. Detective Recarey died in May 2018.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Joseph Recarey was a detective with the Palm Beach Police Department who served as the lead investigator in the case against Jeffrey Epstein. According to court documents and public records, Recarey interviewed over 30 victims during the course of the investigation. His deposition, taken during civil litigation, is referenced in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case documents. Recarey died in May 2018 at age 50, before Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 arrest and before the unsealing of these documents. In our assessment, Detective Recarey was the investigator who documented the pattern of abuse that would eventually form the basis for federal charges, though he did not live to see the case reach its conclusion.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Recarey's investigation:** Detective Recarey conducted extensive interviews with victims, building a case that documented Epstein's pattern of abuse. In our assessment, his investigative work was thorough and professional.

**Regarding the documented victim count:** The fact that Recarey interviewed over 30 victims indicates the scope of Epstein's criminal conduct was apparent to investigators years before federal prosecution.

**Regarding his death:** Recarey died in May 2018, just months before Epstein's July 2019 arrest on federal charges. He did not live to see the case he investigated reach federal prosecution.

**Our editorial judgment:** Recarey represents the dedicated investigators who documented crimes that were, for years, not prosecuted to the extent the evidence warranted. His deposition testimony preserved his investigative findings in the civil litigation record.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Recarey was a dedicated investigator.** He conducted extensive interviews and built a substantial case documenting Epstein's conduct.

2. **The victim count is significant.** Interviewing over 30 victims demonstrates the scale of the investigation and the pattern of criminal conduct it documented.

3. **His deposition preserves critical evidence.** The civil litigation process captured Recarey's investigative findings under oath.

4. **The timing of his death is notable.** Recarey died before Epstein's 2019 arrest and before the full public disclosure of documents.

5. **No criticism of his work is apparent.** The documentary record does not suggest any failure in his investigative duties.

6. **His work laid the foundation.** The 2019 federal case was built on the foundation that Palm Beach investigators, including Recarey, established.

7. **Institutional failures were not his.** Any failures in prosecution reflect decisions made above the investigator level.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
