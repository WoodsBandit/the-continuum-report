## Statement of Public Interest

Berkeley Square in London's Mayfair district appears in court documents as a location associated with Ghislaine Maxwell's London residence. This address gained public significance through allegations made in civil litigation, including claims that a widely circulated photograph of Virginia Giuffre with Prince Andrew was taken at Maxwell's London home. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse regarding locations referenced in the Epstein-Maxwell litigation.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of court documents from *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, Berkeley Square in London appears as a geographic reference associated with Ghislaine Maxwell's London residence. The documentary record suggests this location was part of Epstein and Maxwell's international property portfolio. In our assessment, the London residence is significant primarily because it is identified as the location where a photograph purportedly showing Virginia Giuffre with Prince Andrew was allegedly taken in 2001. The location appears 7 times across 7 documents in the analyzed corpus.

### The Photograph

According to pleadings and public accounts, a widely circulated photograph shows Prince Andrew with his arm around Virginia Giuffre's waist, with Ghislaine Maxwell visible in the background. This photograph purportedly was taken at Maxwell's London residence in 2001, when Giuffre was 17 years old.

In his November 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew questioned whether the photograph was genuine and claimed he had "no recollection" of meeting Virginia Giuffre. Photographic experts who examined the image found no evidence of manipulation.

### Allegations Involving London

According to pleadings in various proceedings, Virginia Giuffre alleged:

- The encounters with Prince Andrew occurred at multiple locations including Maxwell's London residence, Epstein's New York mansion, and Epstein's private island
- Maxwell personally orchestrated and facilitated these encounters

**Note:** Prince Andrew was never criminally charged. His civil lawsuit with Giuffre was settled in February 2022 without admission of liability.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the London residence:** In our assessment, Maxwell's London residence at or near Berkeley Square appears to have served as one of multiple international locations associated with Epstein and Maxwell's activities. The documentary record references this location in connection with witness allegations and discovery disputes.

**Regarding the international property portfolio:** Based on our review, the London residence appears alongside other documented properties including Epstein's Palm Beach mansion, Manhattan townhouse, New Mexico ranch, and U.S. Virgin Islands estate. We interpret the London location as extending Epstein and Maxwell's geographic reach into the United Kingdom.

**Regarding the photograph:** The photograph allegedly taken at Maxwell's London residence remains a significant piece of documentary evidence. In our view, the photograph places Giuffre, Prince Andrew, and Maxwell together at the London residence around 2001 when Giuffre was 17 years old. Prince Andrew's subsequent questioning of the photograph's authenticity was not supported by expert analysis.

**Regarding evidentiary significance:** We note that the London location's significance is primarily circumstantial---it provides geographic context for alleged events but does not independently establish the conduct alleged in pleadings.

**Our editorial judgment:** Berkeley Square represents one node in what court documents suggest was an international network of residences. The location's primary significance lies in its connection to allegations involving Prince Andrew and the photographic evidence associated with those allegations.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret the Berkeley Square evidence differently:

1. **Limited Documentary Evidence:** The 7 document references to Berkeley Square may be incidental geographic notations rather than evidence of significant activity at the location. Court filings often reference addresses for procedural reasons unrelated to alleged conduct.

2. **Address Uncertainty:** Different sources have referenced both Berkeley Square and 44 Kensington Gore as Maxwell's London addresses. The exact property and its significance may be less clear than court references suggest.

3. **Geographic Context Only:** The London location may simply provide geographic context for Maxwell's movements without implying any wrongdoing occurred at that specific address.

4. **Photograph Location Disputed:** While the photograph is widely reported as having been taken at Maxwell's London residence, the exact location has been subject to dispute. The photograph's evidentiary value regarding the London property specifically may be limited.

5. **No Criminal Proceedings:** Unlike Epstein's Palm Beach and Manhattan properties, the London residence was never the subject of law enforcement search warrants or criminal investigation referenced in the analyzed documents.

6. **Alternative Explanations for Photo:** Prince Andrew suggested the photograph may have been manipulated, though expert analysis found no evidence of this. Some observers may still question aspects of the photograph's provenance.

7. **Settlement Without Adjudication:** The Giuffre v. Prince Andrew settlement means allegations involving the London residence were never tested through adversarial legal proceedings. No court made findings regarding events at this location.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
