## The Documented Record

**The following contains only direct quotes and factual citations. No interpretation.**

*Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Discovery Context

The Epstein Florida Case (*Jane Doe #1 and #2 v. United States*, No. 08-cv-80736-KAM) was a Crime Victims' Rights Act enforcement action against the federal government regarding the 2008 non-prosecution agreement.

Glenn Dubin's name appears in the broader documentary record of Epstein-related litigation primarily in discovery contexts—requests for communications and information about Epstein's social and financial network.

### Absence of Direct References

Based on our review of the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* documents that reference the Florida case, we found no specific allegations in the Florida CVRA litigation documents connecting Glenn Dubin to the conduct addressed in that case.

### Social Connection to Epstein

Glenn Dubin and his wife Eva Dubin maintained a social relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This association is referenced in discovery requests but does not appear in the Florida case's substantive allegations regarding the NPA or victims' rights violations.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the nature of the connection:** In our assessment, the connection between the Epstein Florida Case and Glenn Dubin is peripheral and documentary rather than substantive. Dubin's name appears in the broader context of Epstein-related discovery but not in the specific CVRA litigation regarding the non-prosecution agreement.

**Regarding what the Florida case addressed:** The Florida case focused on the government's alleged violation of crime victims' rights by concealing the NPA from victims. It was not primarily concerned with identifying Epstein's associates or network.

**Regarding the absence of allegations:** We find no allegations in the documents that Glenn Dubin was involved in the conduct underlying the Florida case or that he benefited from the NPA's protections.

**Our editorial judgment:** The connection between the Epstein Florida Case and Glenn Dubin is interpretive and weak. While Dubin's social connection to Epstein places him within the network that became the subject of various legal proceedings, the Florida CVRA case does not specifically address or implicate him.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Social connection is not legal connection.** Many individuals knew Epstein socially without involvement in or knowledge of his crimes.

2. **The Florida case focused on government conduct.** The CVRA litigation was about prosecutorial decisions, not about identifying perpetrators beyond Epstein himself.

3. **Discovery scope differs from allegations.** Seeking information about someone does not constitute an allegation against them.

4. **Glenn Dubin has never been charged** with any offense related to Epstein and has not been publicly accused of wrongdoing by prosecutors.

5. **The documentary record is minimal.** Without specific allegations or evidence connecting Dubin to the Florida case, any connection is contextual at most.
