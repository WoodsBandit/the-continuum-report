## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The documentary record places both Ghislaine Maxwell and Sarah Kellen within Jeffrey Epstein's network, and they were named as co-defendants in civil litigation arising from allegations related to Epstein's activities.

Maxwell's deposition testimony claimed she had "no idea" what Kellen did and "no idea" whether Kellen was around girls under 18. We present these responses without characterizing whether they reflect truthful lack of knowledge, deliberate distancing, or other considerations. Maxwell was subsequently convicted in federal court, which may affect assessment of her deposition testimony.

The documents do not detail the specific nature of interactions between Maxwell and Kellen. Both were associated with Epstein—Maxwell as his longtime associate, Kellen as his assistant and scheduler—but whether they worked together directly or operated in separate spheres is not established.

Kellen was designated an unindicted co-conspirator but never charged; Maxwell was convicted. These different outcomes may reflect different roles, different evidence, or different prosecutorial decisions.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Separate spheres:** Maxwell and Kellen may have operated largely independently despite both being associated with Epstein, with limited direct interaction.

2. **Maxwell's credibility:** Maxwell's "no idea" responses were made under oath but prior to her conviction. Her subsequent criminal case may affect how these statements are viewed.

3. **Co-defendant strategy:** Being named together in civil lawsuits reflects plaintiffs' decisions, not necessarily close collaboration.

4. **Different legal outcomes:** Kellen's non-prosecution and Maxwell's conviction suggest prosecutors viewed their situations differently.
