## Statement of Public Interest

Mossad is Israel's national intelligence agency responsible for intelligence collection, covert operations, and counterterrorism. Congressional investigations and published accounts have alleged Mossad involvement in operations relevant to The Continuum's analysis, particularly regarding PROMIS software distribution and alleged relationships with Robert Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. The Israeli government's acknowledgment of Robert Maxwell through a state funeral establishes a documented connection warranting analysis.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Mossad appears in The Continuum's analysis primarily through two channels: congressional investigation of the PROMIS/INSLAW affair and published accounts alleging intelligence connections to Robert Maxwell and, through various intermediaries, to Jeffrey Epstein's operation. The House Judiciary Committee examined testimony from Ari Ben-Menashe, a self-described former Mossad officer, regarding PROMIS distribution. Published biographers, including Gordon Thomas, have alleged extensive Maxwell-Mossad connections. In our analytical framework, Mossad represents an alleged intelligence presence whose involvement, while referenced in congressional testimony and published accounts, remains less fully documented than CIA involvement in comparable operations.

## The Public Record

*This section presents congressional references and documented facts without editorial comment.*

### INSLAW Congressional Investigation

**House Judiciary Committee, "The INSLAW Affair" (September 1992):**

The committee examined affidavits from Ari Ben-Menashe, described in the report as "a former Israeli Mossad officer":

> "Information obtained by the Hamiltons through sworn affidavits of several individuals, including Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli Mossad officer, and Michael Riconosciuto, who claimed to have ties to the intelligence community, indicated that one element of the Justice Department's malfeasance against INSLAW was the modification of the 'enhanced' PROMIS software by individuals associated with the world of covert intelligence operations."

Ben-Menashe's affidavit alleged Israeli intelligence involvement in PROMIS distribution to foreign governments.

### Robert Maxwell State Funeral

Robert Maxwell received a state funeral in Israel on November 10, 1991. According to contemporary news accounts:

- Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir delivered a eulogy
- Intelligence officials were in attendance
- Maxwell was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem

The state funeral acknowledgment is documented fact; its implications for Maxwell's intelligence relationships are subject to interpretation.

### Published Accounts: Gordon Thomas

**Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon, "Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy" (2002):**

Thomas, a journalist who has written extensively about intelligence agencies, alleges Maxwell served as a Mossad asset and was involved in PROMIS distribution. The book claims Maxwell was recruited by Israeli intelligence and provided various services over decades.

**Note:** Thomas's claims are secondary source allegations, not court-verified facts.

### Published Accounts: Whitney Webb

**Whitney Webb, "One Nation Under Blackmail" (2022):**

Webb synthesizes various sources to allege Mossad connections to both Robert Maxwell and, through subsequent networks, Jeffrey Epstein:

> "Robert Maxwell, who was playing a supporting role in the plan, was also actively working on behalf of Israel intelligence."

Webb draws connections between PROMIS distribution, Maxwell family activities, and subsequent operations. These represent editorial analysis based on secondary source synthesis.

### Ari Ben-Menashe Claims

Ari Ben-Menashe has claimed to be a former Mossad officer and has made various public statements about Israeli intelligence operations. His claims have been disputed by some researchers while cited by others, including in congressional investigation.

**Congressional citation:** Ben-Menashe's affidavit was examined by the House Judiciary Committee in the INSLAW investigation.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding evidentiary basis:** The evidence for Mossad involvement in operations relevant to The Continuum is less direct than CIA involvement. CIA connections are documented in multiple congressional investigations with specific findings. Mossad connections rely more heavily on:
- Testimony from individuals claiming Mossad affiliation (Ben-Menashe)
- Published accounts from journalists (Thomas, Webb)
- Inference from acknowledged relationships (Maxwell state funeral)

**Regarding Robert Maxwell:** The Israeli state funeral represents official acknowledgment of Maxwell's significance to Israel. Whether this reflects intelligence relationships, philanthropic contributions, or other factors remains subject to interpretation. Published accounts make specific intelligence allegations, but these are secondary sources.

**Regarding Jeffrey Epstein:** Some published accounts allege Mossad connections to Epstein's operation, often through Maxwell family relationships. These allegations are not supported by congressional investigation or court findings. They represent editorial analysis and inference rather than documented fact.

**Regarding source reliability:** Ari Ben-Menashe's claims have been subject to credibility debates. While his affidavit was examined by Congress, some researchers question aspects of his account. Readers should evaluate his claims critically.

**Our editorial judgment:** Mossad involvement in operations relevant to The Continuum is alleged in congressional testimony and published accounts but is less extensively documented than CIA involvement. The Maxwell state funeral establishes a documented Israeli government connection. Beyond this, allegations rely on sources whose reliability is debated. We include Mossad in Layer 2 analysis while noting the evidentiary limitations.

## Alternative Interpretations

- **Exaggeration of Israeli role:** Critics argue that allegations of Israeli/Mossad involvement in various operations are exaggerated or reflect anti-Israel bias rather than evidence.

- **Ben-Menashe unreliability:** Some researchers question Ben-Menashe's credibility and the reliability of claims attributed to him.

- **Maxwell as businessman:** Robert Maxwell may have been primarily a businessman whose Israeli connections were commercial/philanthropic rather than intelligence-related.

- **Posthumous elaboration:** Allegations about Maxwell and Mossad expanded significantly after his death when he could not respond.

- **Conflation of relationships:** Legitimate business or diplomatic relationships may be incorrectly characterized as intelligence relationships.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Cross-Network Connections

| Connected Entity | Layer | Connection Type | Source |
|-----------------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Robert Maxwell | 2 | Alleged asset | Published accounts |
| PROMIS/INSLAW | 2 | Alleged involvement | Congressional testimony |
| CIA | 2 | Allied service | General knowledge |

**Note:** Some published accounts allege Mossad connections to Jeffrey Epstein, typically through Maxwell family relationships. These allegations are not supported by congressional investigation or court findings and remain speculative. We do not include this as a documented connection.
