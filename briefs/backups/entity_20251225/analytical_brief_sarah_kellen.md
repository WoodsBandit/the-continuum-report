## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. The 2008 non-prosecution agreement involving Jeffrey Epstein and its consequences remain subjects of ongoing public debate and congressional inquiry. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Sarah Kellen appears in court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil defamation case as Jeffrey Epstein's assistant and scheduler. Based on our review, she was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in Epstein's 2008 federal non-prosecution agreement in Florida alongside Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and Nadia Marcinkova. Court filings indicate she invoked Fifth Amendment privileges during civil depositions. Sarah Kellen has never been criminally charged with any offense. Her own account of events does not appear in the analyzed documents, and the reasons for the "unindicted co-conspirator" designation—as well as the decision not to charge her—remain outside the public record.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

We approach this analysis recognizing that the documentary record presents allegations and legal designations without providing Kellen's own account or the full context of prosecutorial decisions.

**Regarding the co-conspirator designation:** Kellen was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2008 non-prosecution agreement. We observe that this designation did not result in criminal charges. The reasons for naming her as a co-conspirator, and the reasons for not charging her, are not explained in the documents we reviewed. We cannot determine whether this reflects: cooperation with investigators, insufficient evidence for charges, prosecutorial discretion, the terms of the controversial NPA itself, or other factors.

**Regarding the Fifth Amendment invocations:** Court filings indicate Kellen invoked Fifth Amendment privileges during civil depositions. We note that this is a constitutionally protected right that may be exercised for many reasons, including on advice of counsel as a precaution. The invocations do not establish any facts about Kellen's conduct and should not be interpreted as admissions.

**Regarding Maxwell's testimony:** Maxwell stated she had "no idea" what Kellen did and "no idea" whether Kellen was around girls under 18. We note these responses without characterizing whether they reflect truthful lack of knowledge, deliberate distancing, or other considerations.

**Regarding civil litigation:** Kellen was named as a defendant in multiple civil lawsuits. We observe that being named in civil litigation reflects plaintiffs' attorneys' decisions about whom to sue, which may be based on many factors including litigation strategy and asset considerations. Civil complaints contain allegations, not established facts.

**Regarding the absence of her account:** We are acutely aware that this analysis presents information about an individual whose own voice is absent from the record due to Fifth Amendment invocations and the nature of the available documents. Any assessment of Kellen's role, knowledge, or culpability is necessarily incomplete without her account.

**Regarding potential alternative circumstances:** We note that the documents do not establish whether Kellen herself may have been subject to coercion, manipulation, or exploitation in her employment with Epstein. Individuals in proximity to predatory individuals sometimes occupy positions that resist simple characterization.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **The absence of charges is significant.** Federal prosecutors had access to extensive evidence and witness testimony. Their decision not to charge Kellen—despite the co-conspirator designation—may reflect an assessment that charges were not warranted or could not be proven.

- **The co-conspirator designation may be a legal technicality.** In federal practice, "unindicted co-conspirator" is a designation that can be applied broadly. It does not require the same evidentiary showing as criminal charges and does not constitute a finding of guilt.

- **Fifth Amendment invocations are constitutionally protected** and should not be held against an individual. Lawyers routinely advise clients to invoke these protections in civil proceedings where criminal exposure may exist, regardless of actual culpability.

- **Employment as an assistant does not establish criminal knowledge.** Many individuals work for people who engage in illegal activity without awareness of that activity. The nature of Kellen's knowledge, if any, is not established in the documents.

- **Kellen may have been a victim herself.** The documents do not address whether Kellen may have been recruited, groomed, or coerced. Her circumstances during her employment with Epstein are not documented.

- **Civil litigation naming is not probative of guilt.** Plaintiffs' attorneys make strategic decisions about whom to name as defendants based on many factors. Being named does not establish wrongdoing.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of approximately 20 documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation.

**What we did not review:**
- Sarah Kellen's own account or testimony (she invoked Fifth Amendment)
- The actual 2008 non-prosecution agreement and its terms
- Prosecutorial memoranda explaining charging decisions
- Any statements Kellen may have made to law enforcement
- Kellen's background, circumstances, or how she came to work for Epstein

**Critical limitation:** This analysis presents a legal designation (unindicted co-conspirator) and litigation history without the subject's own account and without the prosecutorial reasoning behind the decisions made. Any conclusions about Kellen's role or culpability are necessarily speculative.
