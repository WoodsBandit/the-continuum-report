## The Documented Record

**The following contains only direct quotes and factual citations. No interpretation.**

*Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Source: ECF 1331-12 — Sarah Ransome Affidavit

**IMPORTANT:** The following are allegations from a sworn affidavit representing one individual's account.

Regarding observations of Maxwell's role:

> "During one of my visits to the island I met Ghislaine Maxwell. Watching her interact with the other girls on the island, it became clear to me that she recruited all or many of them to the island. Once they were there, she appeared to be in charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with, and how they were supposed to stay in line. She assumed the same supervisory role with me as soon as I arrived."

The affidavit describes Marcinkova's presence at activities also involving Maxwell's supervision:

> "As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, Nadia Macinkova, and various other girls and guests he brought to the island."

### Source: ECF 1328-34 — Co-Conspirator Status

Marcinkova was one of four individuals designated as unindicted co-conspirators:

> "The other people mentioned as co-conspirators are Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, and Nadia Marcinkova."

Maxwell was subsequently convicted in federal court in 2021 on charges related to her role in Epstein's activities.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The documentary record places both Ghislaine Maxwell and Nadia Marcinkova within Epstein's network. Sarah Ransome's affidavit describes Maxwell exercising a supervisory role over girls at Epstein's island while also describing Marcinkova's presence during sexual activities.

We observe that the documents do not detail the specific nature of Maxwell's relationship with Marcinkova. The Ransome affidavit describes Maxwell's supervisory behavior and separately describes Marcinkova's presence, but does not describe direct interactions between Maxwell and Marcinkova.

Maxwell was convicted in 2021 while Marcinkova was never charged. This different legal outcome may reflect different roles, different evidence, or prosecutorial recognition that Marcinkova's situation may be more complex than a straightforward perpetrator categorization.

We note that questions about Marcinkova's potential victimization—whether she herself may have been trafficked or exploited—are not resolved in these documents and would significantly affect any assessment of her relationship with Maxwell.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Supervisory vs. supervised:** If Marcinkova was herself a trafficking victim, her relationship to Maxwell may have been that of someone under Maxwell's control rather than a collaborator.

2. **Different legal outcomes:** Maxwell's conviction and Marcinkova's non-prosecution suggest prosecutors viewed their situations differently.

3. **Limited direct evidence:** The documents describe both women in Epstein's network but do not detail direct interactions between them.

4. **Single witness account:** The primary evidence comes from Ransome's affidavit, which has not been tested through cross-examination.
