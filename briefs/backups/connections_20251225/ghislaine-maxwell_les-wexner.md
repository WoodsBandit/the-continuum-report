*Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Witness References

Per deposition testimony referenced in Giuffre v. Maxwell:
- Witnesses referenced Maxwell's attendance at events at Wexner properties
- Virginia Giuffre referenced Wexner properties in deposition testimony

### Indirect Connection Through Epstein

The connection between Maxwell and Wexner appears to be mediated through Jeffrey Epstein:
- Epstein managed Wexner's finances (1980s-2007)
- Maxwell was Epstein's longtime associate
- Both were present at properties connected to Wexner

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The documentary record suggests the Maxwell-Wexner connection was indirect, mediated through their respective relationships with Jeffrey Epstein. Witness accounts reference Maxwell's presence at Wexner-connected properties, likely reflecting her role in Epstein's social circle.

We observe that the documents do not establish a direct personal or business relationship between Maxwell and Wexner independent of Epstein. Their connection appears to be a function of Epstein's position as Wexner's financial manager and Maxwell's position as Epstein's associate.

Wexner has stated he severed ties with Epstein in 2007. The extent of any ongoing connection to Maxwell after that date is not documented in the materials we reviewed.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Purely incidental:** Maxwell may have encountered Wexner only through Epstein-related social events without independent relationship.

2. **Social circles:** Wealthy individuals' social circles often overlap without implying close personal relationships.

3. **Property presence:** Maxwell's presence at Wexner properties may reflect Epstein's access rather than any relationship with Wexner.

4. **No documented interaction:** The records do not show direct communications or dealings between Maxwell and Wexner.
