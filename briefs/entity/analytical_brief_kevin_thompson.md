## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Thompson was identified during discovery.** Rule 26 disclosures identify individuals who may have relevant knowledge.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Thompson.** He appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is limited.** References within one document do not provide extensive detail.

- **Privacy interests warrant careful treatment.** Individuals identified in discovery are not thereby implicated.

- **Discovery identification is routine.** Both sides in litigation identify persons who may have information.

- **The specific relationship to the case is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
