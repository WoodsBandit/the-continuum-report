## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Glenn Dubin, a hedge fund manager, appears in limited references within court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil defamation case. Based on our review, Maxwell acknowledged knowing Dubin through his wife Eva Dubin, whom Maxwell described as a friend. Deposition questions were asked about whether individuals were sent to provide massages to Dubin, but Maxwell denied recollection of any such instruction. Glenn Dubin has never been charged with any crime. No direct allegations of misconduct by Dubin appear in the analyzed documents—only questions posed by attorneys during depositions.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

We approach this analysis with significant caution. The documentary record regarding Glenn Dubin is notably thin and consists primarily of questions asked by attorneys rather than allegations or testimony establishing any facts about Dubin's conduct.

**Regarding what the documents contain:** The substantive content consists of: (1) Maxwell acknowledging she knows Dubin as Eva Dubin's husband; (2) Maxwell stating Eva Dubin is her friend; (3) attorney questions about whether victims were sent to massage Dubin; (4) Maxwell denying recollection of instructing anyone to massage Dubin; and (5) Marcinkova invoking the Fifth Amendment when asked if she knows Dubin.

**Regarding what the documents do not contain:** We find no testimony from any witness stating that Dubin engaged in any misconduct. We find no victim testimony describing interactions with Dubin. We find no allegations against Dubin—only questions posed by attorneys.

**Regarding the Fifth Amendment invocation:** Marcinkova's invocation of Fifth Amendment privileges when asked if she knows Dubin does not establish any fact about Dubin. Witnesses invoke Fifth Amendment protections for many reasons, including on advice of counsel as a general precaution. The invocation reflects Marcinkova's legal strategy, not information about Dubin.

**Regarding Maxwell's denial:** Maxwell stated she had "no recollection" of instructing anyone to massage Dubin. While "no recollection" is not an absolute denial, we note this is the only substantive response in the record regarding the massage questions, and it is exculpatory.

**Our editorial judgment:** Based solely on the documents analyzed, we do not find a basis for characterizing Glenn Dubin as someone against whom credible allegations exist. The record contains attorney questions—which are not evidence—and responses that are either denials, invocations of constitutional rights, or acknowledgments of social acquaintance.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Attorney questions are not allegations.** Lawyers ask questions to explore possibilities; the questions themselves do not establish that the conduct inquired about occurred.

- **Maxwell's denial should be given weight.** Her statement that she had "no recollection" of instructing anyone to massage Dubin is the only substantive evidence in the record on this point, and it is exculpatory.

- **Social acquaintance with Maxwell is not incriminating.** Many people in New York social and philanthropic circles knew Maxwell without any involvement in or knowledge of illegal activity.

- **The Fifth Amendment invocation is irrelevant to Dubin.** Marcinkova's decision to invoke her constitutional rights when asked if she knows Dubin tells us about Marcinkova's legal posture, not about Dubin.

- **Absence of charges is significant.** Federal investigators had extensive access to witnesses and documents. The absence of any charges against Dubin after thorough investigation may indicate prosecutors found no basis for charges.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of 3 documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation that reference Glenn Dubin.

**What we did not review:**
- Any statements from Glenn Dubin or his representatives
- Any statements from Eva Dubin
- Other litigation or reporting that may reference the Dubins
- The full context of the depositions from which excerpts were drawn

**Critical limitation:** This analysis is based on an extremely limited document set. The references to Dubin are minimal and consist largely of attorney questions rather than testimony or allegations. Readers should not draw broad conclusions from such limited material.
