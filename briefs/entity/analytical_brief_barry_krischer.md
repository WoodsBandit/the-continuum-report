## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Barry Krischer served as Palm Beach County State Attorney during the 2006 prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and made decisions regarding how that case was presented to a grand jury. His handling of the case has been the subject of substantial public debate and media scrutiny, particularly following the release of grand jury records in 2024. These documents were unsealed by court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Barry Krischer served as Palm Beach County State Attorney from 1993 to 2009. In our assessment, he is most notably associated with the original 2006 prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein. The Palm Beach Police Department, led by Chief Michael Reiter and Detective Joseph Recarey, conducted an extensive investigation documenting allegations from multiple underage victims. Police recommended felony charges. According to the documentary record and subsequent reporting, Krischer's office took the case to a grand jury where prosecutors presented only a single charge of soliciting prostitution, which resulted in an indictment on that lesser charge in July 2006. Based on our review, this prosecutorial approach was publicly criticized by Palm Beach Police officials at the time and has remained controversial. The 2024 unsealing of grand jury records revealed that prosecutors characterized victims as prostitutes during the proceeding. Krischer has never been charged with any crime and has publicly stated that federal prosecutors could have filed their own charges regardless of his office's handling of the state case.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents without editorial comment.*

### Palm Beach Police Investigation (2005-2006)

**[ECF Doc. 1320-13](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-13.pdf), filed 01/03/24** (Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report, Case No. 1-05-000368):

The police report documents Detective Joseph Recarey's investigation and interactions with the State Attorney's Office. The report references coordination with State Attorney personnel:

> "I then made telephone contact with the State Attorneys Office and confirmed that subpoenas would be issued to the former employees to assist in the investigation."

Regarding the deal offered by the State Attorney's Office:

> "At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic in their offices. I entered ASA Belohlavic's office who informed me that she was going to return my call. She explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty Guy Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with adjudication withheld."

Regarding the Grand Jury decision:

> "She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was requesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again."

Detective Recarey's apparent frustration with the outcome:

> "I explained my disapproval of the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered. However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal."

Grand jury result documented in the police report:

> "On July 19, 2006, I responded to the Grand Jury Room and testified before the grand jury. At the conclusion, ASA Belohlavec stated the grand jury returned with a true bill for Felony Solicitation of Prostitution."

### Police Request for Felony Charges

**[ECF Doc. 1320-13](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-13.pdf), filed 01/03/24:**

The police report documents that Detective Recarey submitted arrest warrant requests for more serious charges:

> "On May 1, 2006, I prepared three arrest warrant requests and submitted them to the State Attorney's Office. The packages were delivered to the Crimes against Children Unit in care of ASA Lana Belohlavek. Jeffrey Epstein's arrest warrant was requested for 4 counts of Unlawful Sexual activity with certain minors and one count of Lewd and Lascivious Molestation."

### 2024 Grand Jury Record Release

According to public reporting following the July 2024 release of grand jury records, prosecutors in Krischer's office characterized victims as prostitutes and challenged their credibility during the grand jury proceeding.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Krischer's prosecutorial decision:** In our assessment, the contrast between the Palm Beach Police Department's recommendation for multiple felony charges and the single solicitation charge presented to the grand jury represents a significant prosecutorial choice. The police investigation documented allegations from multiple underage victims who described sexual abuse. The State Attorney's Office ultimately presented a charge that characterized the conduct as soliciting prostitution rather than sexual abuse of minors. We interpret this decision as consequential, though prosecutorial discretion is broad and we acknowledge we do not have access to all factors that may have influenced this choice.

**Regarding the relationship with police:** The documentary record suggests tension between the Palm Beach Police Department and the State Attorney's Office regarding the handling of this case. Detective Recarey documented his "disapproval of the deal" in official police records. According to public reporting, Police Chief Michael Reiter publicly criticized the prosecution. In our view, this tension between local law enforcement and prosecutors appears unusual and noteworthy.

**Regarding the grand jury proceeding:** The 2024 release of grand jury records reportedly revealed that prosecutors in Krischer's office characterized victims as prostitutes before the grand jury. Some legal observers have interpreted this approach as undermining rather than supporting the case against Epstein. We note this interpretation while acknowledging that prosecutorial strategy can be legitimately debated.

**Regarding institutional context:** Krischer's office handled this case during a period when Epstein had assembled a legal team that included prominent attorneys such as Alan Dershowitz, Roy Black, and later Jack Goldberger. In our assessment, the resources available to wealthy defendants can influence case outcomes, though we draw no specific conclusions about what occurred here.

**Our editorial judgment:** Based on our review of the documentary record, the handling of the Epstein case by the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office has been the subject of legitimate public concern and criticism. The contrast between the extensive police investigation and the relatively minor charge that resulted from the grand jury proceeding raises questions that, in our view, remain incompletely answered. Krischer has not been charged with any wrongdoing, and we note that prosecutorial decisions involve judgment calls that may look different in retrospect than they did at the time.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Prosecutorial discretion is broad and legitimate.** State attorneys have wide latitude in charging decisions. Krischer may have assessed the evidence, considered trial risks, evaluated victim cooperation issues, and made a reasonable professional judgment that the solicitation charge was most likely to succeed or was appropriate given the circumstances.

2. **Grand jury strategy may differ from trial strategy.** Presenting a narrower charge to a grand jury could reflect legitimate prosecutorial tactics rather than an attempt to undermine the case. Prosecutors must consider what charges they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

3. **The absence of criminal charges against Krischer reflects official judgment.** No prosecutor, disciplinary body, or other authority has determined that Krischer acted improperly. His conduct has been scrutinized extensively, and the absence of charges is significant.

4. **The federal non-prosecution agreement was the primary failure.** Krischer has pointed out that federal prosecutors could have filed their own charges regardless of how state charges were handled. The NPA negotiated by U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta's office may bear more responsibility for the ultimate outcome.

5. **Victim credibility issues may have been real.** Defense attorneys provided materials to prosecutors regarding victims' social media activity and alleged drug use. Prosecutors may have legitimately considered these issues in assessing case strength.

6. **Evidence available in 2006 differed from what emerged later.** The investigation developed over time. What is known now may not have been as clear to prosecutors in 2006 when they made their decisions.

7. **Public criticism of prosecutors is common and does not establish misconduct.** Law enforcement and prosecutors often disagree on case handling. Police frustration with prosecutorial decisions, while notable, does not by itself indicate wrongdoing by the prosecutor.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
