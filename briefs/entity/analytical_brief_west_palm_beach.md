## Statement of Public Interest

West Palm Beach, Florida appears in court documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein matter as a geographic reference point connected to flight records, legal proceedings, and witness activities. As a municipality adjacent to Palm Beach, it is referenced in the context of aviation logistics, witness residences, and institutional settings. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, and this analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of court documents, West Palm Beach, Florida appears as a secondary but recurring geographic reference in the Epstein-related civil litigation. In our assessment, the location's primary significance relates to its role as an aviation hub—flight manifests documented in court filings indicate that Jeffrey Epstein's private aircraft made multiple arrivals and departures from West Palm Beach airports. The location also appears in connection with witness residences, deposition locations, and institutional references including Palm Beach Atlantic College and local educational institutions.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Aviation Records

Court documents reference West Palm Beach in connection with flight manifests for Jeffrey Epstein's private aircraft.

**[ECF Doc. 1320-6](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-6.pdf), filed 01/03/24:**

> "According to flight manifests, in that same general time period, Defendant was listed as a passenger at least eleven times either landing in or departing from West Palm Beach, Florida on Jeffrey Epstein's private plane."

This reference indicates that Ghislaine Maxwell was documented as a passenger on flights to or from West Palm Beach, Florida.

### Law Enforcement Context

Palm Beach Police Department reports reference West Palm Beach in the context of their investigation. The adjacent municipality is noted in police incident reports as part of the broader geographic context.

**[ECF Doc. 1320-13](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-13.pdf):**

Police reports document investigative activity throughout Palm Beach County, with references to West Palm Beach as a location where witnesses resided or where investigative activities occurred.

### Witness References

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding West Palm Beach as Aviation Hub:** We observe that West Palm Beach appears in court documents primarily in connection with flight manifests. In our interpretation, this reflects the location's role as a regional aviation center, with airports serving the greater Palm Beach area.

**Regarding Geographic Distinction:** In our assessment, it is important to distinguish West Palm Beach from Palm Beach. While Palm Beach (the town) is where Jeffrey Epstein's El Brillo Way residence was located, West Palm Beach is a separate, larger municipality adjacent to Palm Beach. Court documents sometimes reference both locations in related contexts.

**Regarding Witness Context:** Based on our review, several witnesses appear to have had connections to the West Palm Beach area, either through residence, employment, or educational institutions. Palm Beach Atlantic College is referenced in multiple documents.

**Regarding Investigative Scope:** We interpret the references to West Palm Beach as reflecting the broader geographic scope of the Palm Beach Police Department investigation, which extended beyond the immediate town of Palm Beach to the surrounding Palm Beach County area.

**Our editorial judgment:** West Palm Beach serves as a geographic anchor point that complements the primary Palm Beach location, particularly in the context of aviation records and witness residences.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret the West Palm Beach references differently:

1. **Administrative Distinction:** Some may view the distinction between West Palm Beach and Palm Beach as primarily administrative, with the locations functioning as a single metropolitan area for practical purposes.

2. **Aviation Focus:** The prominence of aviation-related references may simply reflect that West Palm Beach International Airport (now Palm Beach International Airport) is the nearest major commercial airport to Palm Beach.

3. **Document Selection:** The frequency of West Palm Beach mentions may be influenced by which documents were selected for filing in the civil litigation, rather than reflecting proportional activity in that location.

4. **Peripheral Significance:** Some might view West Palm Beach as peripheral to the main events documented in court filings, which appear centered on the Palm Beach residence.

5. **Institutional Context:** References to Palm Beach Atlantic and other institutions may simply reflect the educational backgrounds of various witnesses rather than substantive connection to events.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
