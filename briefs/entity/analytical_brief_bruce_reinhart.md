- **Reinhart was identified during discovery.** His prior professional activities in South Florida may be relevant context.

- **His judicial role is separate.** His current position as a federal judge is distinct from prior activities.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in documents reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Reinhart.** He appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is limited.** Two mentions do not provide extensive detail about his role.

- **His prosecutorial background may be contextually relevant.** As a former AUSA, he may have had professional knowledge of South Florida matters.

- **The specific relationship to the case is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.
