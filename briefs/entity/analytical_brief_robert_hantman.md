- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Hantman.** He appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is very limited.** Two mentions do not provide extensive detail about his role.

- **Many witnesses appear in complex litigation.** Such identification is routine in comprehensive discovery.

- **The specific nature of the reference is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

- **His connection to the case may be tangential.** Limited mentions suggest peripheral rather than central involvement.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
