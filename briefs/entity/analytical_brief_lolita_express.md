## Statement of Public Interest

Jeffrey Epstein's Boeing 727 aircraft, colloquially known as the "Lolita Express," became a subject of significant public interest due to flight logs entered as evidence in civil litigation. The aircraft's flight records documented travel between Epstein's various properties and identified passengers who flew on the aircraft over an extended period. These records were referenced extensively in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case and were unsealed by federal court order in January 2024, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. The flight logs from this aircraft have been central to understanding travel patterns and associations in litigation related to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking operation. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The "Lolita Express" is the colloquial name given to Jeffrey Epstein's Boeing 727 aircraft, tail number N908JE. In our assessment, based on court filings in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case, this aircraft—along with Epstein's Gulfstream jet—was used to transport passengers between Epstein's multiple properties in Palm Beach, Manhattan, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, and international destinations.

The aircraft gained its name from media coverage following the release of flight logs that documented passenger manifests. Court filings cite these flight logs extensively, establishing that Ghislaine Maxwell traveled on Epstein's aircraft over 300 times, and flew with Virginia Giuffre 23 times while Giuffre was underage. The logs were maintained by Epstein's pilots, David Rodgers and Larry Visoski, and were entered as exhibits during David Rodgers' June 3, 2016 deposition.

Based on our review, the flight logs from this aircraft represent contemporaneous documentary evidence that has been used to corroborate (or contradict) witness testimony in civil litigation. The aircraft's role in facilitating travel between Epstein's properties makes it a significant element in understanding the operational infrastructure alleged in court filings.

> "In the summer of 2006, when I was twenty-two years old and living in New York, I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein by a girl I had met named Natalya Malyshov. Shortly after meeting Jeffrey he invited me to fly to his private island in the US Virgin Islands, which I did. After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction. I am told that my name appears on the flight logs of one or more of those trips."

### Aircraft Destinations

Court documents establish that Epstein's aircraft traveled to the following destinations:

- Palm Beach, Florida
- Manhattan, New York
- Little St. James Island, U.S. Virgin Islands (Epstein's private island)
- Zorro Ranch, New Mexico
- Paris, France
- London, England
- Newark, New Jersey (EWR)
- Teterboro, New Jersey

**[ECF Doc. 1328-7](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-7.pdf), filed 01/05/24**:

> "Defendant even testified that she did not recall having Ms. Giuffre at her London townhome with Prince Andrew. Defendant stuck to this incredible story despite flight logs establishing her traveling to London with Ms. Giuffre and despite a photograph the three – Ms. Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Defendant – all standing together in Defendant's home."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the aircraft's significance:** In our assessment, the Boeing 727 aircraft known as the "Lolita Express" served as critical transportation infrastructure in what court filings describe as Epstein's operation. The aircraft facilitated movement between Epstein's multiple properties—Palm Beach, Manhattan, the Virgin Islands, New Mexico—allowing for travel beyond the jurisdiction of any single law enforcement agency. The private nature of the aircraft meant passengers were not subject to the commercial airline screening or documentation that would typically apply to international travel.

**Regarding the flight logs as evidence:** We view the flight logs maintained by pilots David Rodgers and Larry Visoski as among the most significant documentary evidence in the Epstein-related litigation. Unlike testimony that can be challenged on grounds of memory or credibility, pilot logbooks are contemporaneous records created as part of aviation regulatory requirements. The court filing's assertion that Maxwell appeared "over 300 times" on Epstein's aircraft and traveled with Giuffre "23 times when Ms. Giuffre was underage" derives from these contemporaneous records.

**Regarding the "Lolita Express" name:** The colloquial name, while sensationalized, appears in court filings with citation to its media origin. The name entered public discourse following the January 2015 Daily Mail article that first published excerpts of flight logs. We interpret the adoption of this name in media coverage as reflecting public concern about the nature of activities alleged to have occurred in connection with travel on the aircraft.

**Regarding contradictions with testimony:** Court filings highlight what Plaintiff characterized as Maxwell's inability to recall flights documented in the logs. The assertion that Maxwell "couldn't recall" even one of 300 documented flights, when juxtaposed with contemporaneous pilot records, appears to have been offered as evidence of evasive testimony rather than genuine memory limitation.

**Regarding passenger identification:** The flight logs documented numerous prominent individuals traveling on Epstein's aircraft. In our assessment, presence on these flight manifests establishes only that an individual traveled on a particular flight—it does not, by itself, establish knowledge of or participation in alleged criminal activity. Many passengers may have traveled for entirely legitimate purposes.

**Our editorial judgment:** The "Lolita Express" represents the physical infrastructure that, according to court filings, enabled the movement of individuals between Epstein's properties. The flight logs from this aircraft constitute critical documentary evidence that provided contemporaneous corroboration of travel patterns. The aircraft's significance lies not in the aircraft itself, but in the documentary record of who traveled where and when—evidence that proved central to civil litigation and informed public understanding of the scope of Epstein's operations.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **The colloquial name is sensationalized.** The "Lolita Express" name originated in tabloid media coverage, not court proceedings. The aircraft was a Boeing 727 used by a wealthy individual for private travel—a practice common among ultra-high-net-worth individuals for legitimate business and personal purposes.

2. **Flight logs document presence, not purpose.** Being listed as a passenger on the aircraft establishes only that a person traveled on that flight. It does not establish the purpose of travel, knowledge of other passengers' activities, or participation in any alleged wrongdoing.

3. **Many passengers had legitimate reasons to travel.** Epstein maintained extensive business and philanthropic interests. Many individuals documented on flight logs may have traveled for entirely legitimate reasons—business meetings, social events, charitable work—with no knowledge of any alleged criminal conduct.

4. **The "300 flights" figure requires context.** Maxwell worked with Epstein for approximately 17 years. Over that extended period, 300 flights may not be unusual for someone in her role. This averages to fewer than 18 flights per year, which may be consistent with legitimate professional travel.

5. **Memory limitations may be genuine.** Maxwell's testified inability to recall specific flights from years or decades earlier may reflect genuine memory limitations rather than deliberate evasion. Most individuals would struggle to recall details of specific trips from 10-20 years prior.

6. **Private aircraft use is common among the wealthy.** The use of private aircraft for travel is routine among ultra-high-net-worth individuals. The existence of private aircraft and detailed flight logs is not, by itself, indicative of wrongdoing.

7. **The aircraft was one of multiple modes of transport.** Court filings also reference commercial flights arranged by Epstein. The focus on the Boeing 727 may overemphasize one transportation method when other means of travel were also used.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
