## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Adriana Ross was one of four women—along with Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, and Lesley Groff—who received immunity as part of Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with federal prosecutors in Florida. Court documents describe her role within Epstein's operation. Despite being named as a potential co-conspirator and receiving immunity, Ross was never criminally charged. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Adriana Ross appears in court documents as one of the "Core Four" women who worked for Jeffrey Epstein and received immunity in the 2008 NPA. Based on our review, Ross's role was described as administrative support within Epstein's operation. She was identified in court filings and investigative documents as someone with knowledge of Epstein's activities. Ross invoked Fifth Amendment protections during depositions in civil litigation. Despite receiving immunity as part of the NPA—which protected her from prosecution for conduct that could have formed the basis for federal charges—Ross has never been criminally charged with any offense related to the Epstein matter.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents without editorial comment.*

### 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement

The 2008 NPA between Jeffrey Epstein and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida included immunity provisions for four named individuals:
- Sarah Kellen
- Nadia Marcinkova
- Adriana Ross
- Lesley Groff

The immunity provisions protected these individuals from federal prosecution for conduct that could have been charged in connection with Epstein's activities.

### Role Description

Court filings and investigative documents describe Adriana Ross's role within Epstein's operation:

**Administrative Support:**
Ross was described as providing administrative support within Epstein's operation. Her specific duties included handling scheduling and logistical matters.

**Presence at Properties:**
Documents indicate Ross was present at Epstein's properties in Palm Beach and elsewhere.

### Fifth Amendment Invocations

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the immunity grant:** The 2008 NPA provided immunity to Ross along with three other women who worked for Epstein. In our assessment, the fact that prosecutors sought to include immunity provisions for these individuals suggests they were potential subjects of investigation whose cooperation or non-prosecution was exchanged as part of the broader agreement.

**Regarding Fifth Amendment invocations:** Ross's invocation of Fifth Amendment protections during civil depositions indicates she faced potential criminal exposure from answering questions about her activities. The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled self-incrimination, and its invocation suggests that truthful answers might have been incriminating.

**Regarding the absence of charges:** Despite the immunity grant suggesting potential criminal exposure, and despite the Fifth Amendment invocations suggesting awareness of that exposure, Ross was never charged with any crime. The immunity agreement foreclosed federal prosecution for covered conduct, but state prosecution remained theoretically possible.

**Regarding the "Core Four":** Ross is consistently grouped with Kellen, Marcinkova, and Groff as the four women closest to Epstein's operation who received immunity. This grouping appears in both legal documents and investigative reporting, suggesting these four occupied a distinct role.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record establishes that Ross received immunity as part of the 2008 NPA and invoked Fifth Amendment protections in subsequent proceedings. These facts suggest awareness of potential criminal exposure. However, absent criminal prosecution or testimony under immunity, the specific nature and extent of Ross's knowledge or participation remains undocumented in court findings.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Immunity does not establish guilt.** Receipt of immunity as part of a plea agreement reflects prosecutorial strategy, not judicial determination of wrongdoing. Immunity is often granted to witnesses to secure cooperation, not just to potential defendants.

2. **Fifth Amendment invocations are constitutional rights.** Invocation of Fifth Amendment protections is a constitutional right that creates no inference of guilt. Courts repeatedly instruct juries not to draw adverse inferences from such invocations.

3. **Administrative roles may have limited knowledge.** Someone providing administrative support might have limited awareness of illegal activities even if present at locations where such activities occurred.

4. **The NPA was later invalidated.** A federal judge ruled the 2008 NPA violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by excluding victims from the agreement process. This undermines the agreement's validity, though the immunity provisions were not rescinded.

5. **No victim testimony implicates Ross.** Unlike some other individuals in Epstein's orbit, the unsealed documents do not contain specific victim allegations against Ross personally.

6. **Passage of time affects prosecution.** Even absent immunity, statutes of limitation and evidentiary challenges would complicate any prosecution decades after the alleged conduct.

7. **State charges were never filed.** Despite the federal immunity, Florida state prosecutors could theoretically have brought charges but chose not to do so.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
