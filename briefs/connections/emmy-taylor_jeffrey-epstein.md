> "Q. And what happened that second time you came to the house?
> A. At that point, I met Emmy Taylor, and she took me up to Jeffrey's bathroom and he was present. And her and I both massaged Jeffrey. She was showing me how to massage.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, the documentary record establishes that Emmy Taylor worked in proximity to Jeffrey Epstein through her role as Ghislaine Maxwell's assistant. Deposition testimony places Taylor at Epstein's Palm Beach residence during activities described as "massages."

We observe that the testimony comes from another individual's account. Taylor's own perspective, her understanding of events, and her circumstances are absent from the documents we reviewed. The nature of her employment relationship and how she came to work for Maxwell are not documented.

It appears that Taylor was sought for deposition in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation, with 3.5 hours allocated for her testimony. The outcome of any such deposition is not reflected in the documents available to us.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Employment context:** Taylor may have performed duties she believed were legitimate employment tasks without full awareness of their broader context or Epstein's activities.

2. **Potential coercion:** As an employee in a hierarchical relationship, Taylor may have faced pressure to comply with instructions that she did not fully understand or could not safely refuse.

3. **Absence of charges:** Despite being named in discovery requests, Taylor has never been charged with any crime, which may reflect prosecutorial assessment that charges were not warranted.

4. **Incomplete record:** Taylor's own account is essential to fair assessment, and its absence means conclusions are necessarily provisional.
