Maxwell's First Request for Production responses stated that Giuffre's requests:

> "sought, inter alia: all communications with thirteen specific witnesses, namely Jeffrey Epstein, Virginia Roberts, Prince Andrew, Ross Gow, Alan Dershowitz, Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Glenn and Eva Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcincova and Bill and Hillary Clinton."

Both Prince Andrew and Sarah Kellen appear on this list of thirteen specific witnesses for whom Giuffre sought all communications with Maxwell.

**[ECF Doc. 1327-14](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-14.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24:

Maxwell's attorney Laura Menninger distinguished Prince Andrew and Sarah Kellen (among others) from hundreds of other proposed witness names, noting they were among a limited group "for whom Giuffre had specifically requested all communications."

### Overlapping Network Context

Both individuals appear in the documentary record as part of Jeffrey Epstein's network:

- **Prince Andrew:** Named in allegations by Virginia Giuffre; settled civil lawsuit February 2022
- **Sarah Kellen:** Named as unindicted co-conspirator in 2008 NPA; Epstein's assistant

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the documentary connection:** In our assessment, the connection between Prince Andrew and Sarah Kellen is documentary rather than direct. Both appear on the same discovery request list, indicating Giuffre sought communications with each of them. This establishes they were both relevant to her claims against Maxwell.

**Regarding Kellen's role:** Kellen served as Epstein's scheduler and assistant. In this capacity, she would have been involved in arranging logistics for visitors to Epstein's properties, potentially including any visits involving Prince Andrew.

**Regarding direct interaction evidence:** The documents we reviewed do not contain testimony or evidence of direct communications or interactions between Prince Andrew and Sarah Kellen specifically. Their connection appears through the common nexus of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Prince Andrew-Sarah Kellen connection reflects their positions within Epstein's network rather than a documented direct relationship. Both were named as significant witnesses in Giuffre's litigation against Maxwell.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Documentary co-occurrence is not relationship evidence.** Appearing on the same discovery request list establishes relevance to litigation, not personal connection.

2. **Kellen's administrative role** may have involved scheduling for individuals who visited Epstein without establishing personal relationships with those individuals.

3. **Different legal postures:** Prince Andrew was accused by Giuffre directly; Kellen was designated a co-conspirator. These are distinct legal categories.

4. **The absence of direct evidence** of communication between these individuals may simply reflect the scope of available documents rather than the absence of interaction.

5. **Settlement confidentiality:** Prince Andrew's 2022 settlement did not include disclosure of information about other individuals, limiting what can be known.
