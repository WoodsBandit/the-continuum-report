## THE DEBATE: BUSH VS. KILGORE

### Vannevar Bush Position
- Scientists should control new agency
- Government oversight would jeopardize research quality
- Focus on basic research; elite institutions
- Protect scientific autonomy

### Senator Harley Kilgore Position
- Government should direct research toward social/economic issues
- Retain public ownership of patents
- Redistribute resources beyond top northeastern schools
- More democratic control

### Both Agreed
- Extensive federal commitment to science needed
- Would ensure postwar prosperity
- Would maintain military strength
- Federal funding essential

## LEGISLATIVE STRUGGLE

### 1947 Veto
- Congress passed research bill
- Truman vetoed (wanted more presidential control)
- James Webb (future NASA administrator) advised veto

### Compromise (1950)
- More presidential oversight than Bush wanted
- Less populist than Kilgore wanted
- National Science Board: 24 part-time members
- Director as chief executive (presidential appointee)

### May 10, 1950
- Truman signed NSF Act
- Agency finally created after 5-year debate

## FIRST DIRECTOR

### ALAN T. WATERMAN

#### Background
- Chief scientist, Office of Naval Research
- Former physics professor at Yale
- Nominated early March 1951

#### Religion
- Not documented in sources

#### Politics
- Scientific establishment figure; acceptable to both sides

## WWII ORIGINS

### Office of Scientific Research and Development
- Bush headed OSRD during WWII
- Coordinated wartime R&D
- Manhattan Project, radar, penicillin, other breakthroughs
- Proved value of federal research investment

### "Science: The Endless Frontier"
- Bush's 1945 report
- Argued basic research was foundation of national progress
- Government should fund but not direct research
- Scientists knew best where breakthroughs would occur

---

## NOT QUITE BUSH'S VISION

### Diminished Role
- NSF didn't become dominant research funder Bush envisioned
- By 1950, other agencies (Navy, AEC, NIH) already funding research
- NSF became one player among many
- Some historians view final form as "defeat" for Bush

---

## MISSION TODAY

### Basic Research Support
- Funds approximately 25% of all federally supported basic research
- Supports research at colleges and universities
- All fields of science and engineering (except medical)
- Graduate fellowships and education programs

### Budget
- Approximately $9+ billion annually
- Funds approximately 11,000 awards per year
