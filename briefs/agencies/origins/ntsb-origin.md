## CREATION OF NTSB

### Department of Transportation Act (1966)
- Congress consolidated U.S. transportation agencies into new DOT
- Established NTSB as independent agency within DOT
- Multi-modal jurisdiction: aviation, highways, rail, marine, pipelines

- 1967-1975: NTSB reported to DOT for administrative purposes
- But investigated Federal Aviation Administration (also DOT agency)
- Conflict of interest inherent in structure

### Full Independence (1975)
- Independent Safety Board Act of 1974
- April 1, 1975: NTSB became fully independent agency
- No longer within DOT structure
- Reports directly to Congress
