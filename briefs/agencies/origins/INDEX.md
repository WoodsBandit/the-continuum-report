## METHODOLOGY

**Research Protocol:**
1. Primary sources: Agency official histories, founding documents
2. Secondary sources: Academic histories, biographies
3. Focus: Documented facts only; "not documented" noted when information unavailable
4. Bias awareness: Noted when founders' views changed over time or were contested

**Limitations:**
- Religion often not documented in official sources
- Political views may be inferred from party affiliation but not always explicit
- Views on Constitution/America require interpretation of historical statements
