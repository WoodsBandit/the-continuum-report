# ANALYTICAL BRIEF: NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

NOAA is the federal agency for ocean, weather, and climate science, established October 3, 1970. With ~$6-7B budget and 12,000+ employees, it operates six line offices including NWS, NMFS, and satellites. Faces Sharpie-gate legacy, climate data integrity questions, and 2025 restructuring with 27% proposed cuts.

## 5. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES

### Sharpie-gate (September 2019)
- Trump displayed altered Hurricane Dorian map showing Alabama
- NOAA issued contested statement contradicting NWS Birmingham
- July 2025: Inspector General confirmed White House pressure
- Neil Jacobs and Julie Kay Roberts violated scientific integrity policies
- Two officials placed on administrative leave (July 2025)

### Climate Data Integrity (2024-2025)
- Billion-Dollar Disasters database scrutinized
- June 2024: Failed NOAA Information Quality standards
- May 2025: Database cancelled (~$300K/year program)
- First half 2025: $101.4 billion in damages not tracked by NOAA
- April 2025: Climate Literacy Guide removed from Climate.gov
- Climate Central nonprofit assumed database maintenance

### Fisheries Management
- NMFS staff reductions ~30% in 2025
- 13 positions cut at Alaska Fisheries Science Center
- Reduced survey capacity forcing outdated data reliance
- Chinook salmon bycatch: NOAA denied emergency action (January 2024)

### 2025 Restructuring
- February 2025: ~880 employees terminated (7.3% of workforce)
- April 2025: 1,029 buyouts/deferred resignations approved
- DOGE entered NOAA headquarters February 4, 2025
- Proposed: Transfer NMFS to FWS; eliminate OAR
- 30 NWS offices without lead meteorologist (May 2025)
- Project 2025 calls for NWS "commercialization" and NOAA "broken up"

---

## 6. RELATIONSHIPS

- Commerce: Parent agency; Administrator is Under Secretary of Commerce
- NASA: Research-to-operations transition; shared weather/climate work
- EPA: Marine debris coordination; coastal environmental protection
- Coast Guard: Maritime safety, Arctic oil spill training, navigation
