## HIGH PRIORITY REQUESTS

### Request 1: Epstein Investigation Files (2005-2007)

**Subject:** Jeffrey Edward Epstein

**Records Sought:**

## FBI VAULT CHECK LIST

Before filing FOIA requests, check FBI Vault (vault.fbi.gov) for already-released materials:

- [ ] Jeffrey Epstein — **8 files exist** (Parts 1-8, image-based PDFs)

- [ ] Meyer Lansky — Check for existing release
- [ ] Robert Maxwell — Check for existing release

3. **Exemptions:** Expect significant redactions under Exemption 7 (law enforcement) and Exemption 6 (privacy). Appeal process available.

4. **Timeline:** FBI FOIA responses typically take 6-18 months. Expedited processing rarely granted.
