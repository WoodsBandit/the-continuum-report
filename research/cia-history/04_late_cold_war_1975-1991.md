## Drug Trafficking Connections

### Overview
The 1980s Central America operations produced extensive documented evidence of CIA awareness, and in some cases facilitation, of drug trafficking by Contra forces and their supporters. Multiple investigations confirmed elements of these allegations despite official denials.

### Gary Webb Investigation (1996)

**Series:** "Dark Alliance: The Story Behind the Crack Explosion"
**Publication:** San Jose Mercury News, August 1996
**Focus:** Three-part investigative series

**Core Allegations:**
- Nicaraguan traffickers allied with CIA-backed Contras supplied cocaine to U.S.
- Cocaine sold in bulk to Los Angeles dealer "Freeway" Ricky Ross
- Distributed through Crips and Bloods gangs
- Profits funded Contra war against Sandinistas
- CIA "turned a blind eye" because it served U.S. geopolitical goals
- Reagan administration shielded drug dealers from prosecution

**Predecessor Investigation:**
- 1985: Associated Press (Robert Parry and Brian Barger)
- Found Contra groups "engaged in cocaine trafficking, in part to help finance their war"

### Kerry Committee Findings (1989)

**Committee:** Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations
**Chairman:** Senator John Kerry
**Report Date:** 1989
**Length:** 1,166 pages

**Key Conclusions:**
- Individuals providing Contra support were involved in drug trafficking
- Contra supply network used by drug trafficking organizations
- Elements of Contras themselves knowingly received financial and material assistance from drug traffickers
- U.S. officials provided drug traffickers with assistance in return for support of Contras

**Investigation Timeline:**
- Began: February 1988 (during drug trafficking/foreign policy hearings)
- Trigger: BCCI identified in Noriega money laundering
- Duration: 4 years

### CIA Inspector General Reports (1998)

**Inspector General:** Frederick Hitz
**Release Date:** March 1998 (two reports)
**Significance:** Internal CIA investigation with admissions

**Findings:**
- CIA covered up Contra drug trafficking for more than a decade
- Agency aware of Contra involvement
- Failed to fully investigate allegations
- Failed to act upon allegations
- In some cases dissuaded DEA and other agencies from investigating Contra supply networks

**Hitz Assessment:** "Confirmed key chunks of Webb's allegations" (journalist Nick Schou)

**Retrospective (Hitz):** "We fell down on accountability... There was a great deal of sloppiness and poor guidance in those days out of Washington"

### Ilopango Airport Operations (El Salvador)

**Location:** Ilopango Airport, El Salvador
**Period:** 1980s
**CIA Role:** Operated Hangars 4 and 5

#### DEA Agent Celerino Castillo Allegations

**Position:** DEA Special Agent, Guatemala City Country Office
**Documentation:**
- Pilot names
- Aircraft tail numbers
- Dates and times
- Flight plans
- Reports sent to DEA headquarters

**Allegations:**
- Contras used Ilopango for drug smuggling flights
- CIA had full knowledge
- Pilots working for Contras did own trafficking "on the side"
- Could smuggle with impunity (flew on "same airline as Oliver North")
- DEA ordered Castillo not to investigate
- Salvadoran investigation limited "for security reasons"

**Case Opening Report:**
- Based on two informant reports
- Investigation of air smuggling by Contra-associated subjects
- Coordination with Salvadoran police
- Focus on hangars 4 and 5
- Informant working at Ilopango kept Castillo informed

#### CIA Declassified Report Evidence

**450-Page CIA Inspector General Report:**
- CIA did "little or nothing" to respond to hundreds of drug allegations
- Nearly 1,000 cables from field to headquarters contained allegations
- Allegations about Contra officials, contractors, individual supporters
- In some cases, instructed DEA to hold back inquiries

**Specific Example - Carlos Alberto Amador:**
- August 1985 CIA cable identified Amador as veteran Contra supply pilot
- Scheduled to ferry planes Miami to Colombia for drug trafficking use
- 1986 CIA cable: DEA source info that Amador flew cocaine San Salvador to Florida
- CIA headquarters to San Salvador station regarding Hangar 4: "Would appreciate Station advising DEA not to make any inquiries to anyone re Hanger no. 4 at Ilopango since only legitimate... supported operations were conducted from this facility"

### DEA Field Agent Testimony

**Agent:** Hector Berrellez (DEA field agent)
**Forum:** PBS Frontline investigation
**Statement:** "I believe that elements working for the CIA were involved in bringing drugs into the country"

**Details:**
- "Some of the CIA contract workers, meaning some of the pilots, in fact were bringing drugs into the U.S."
- Landing some drugs "in government air bases"
- Pilots helping Contras engaged in trafficking with protection

### Documented Traffickers with Contra Ties

**Undisputed Convictions:**
- Danilo Blandon (Contra sympathizer, convicted drug trafficker)
- Norwin Meneses (ties to Contras, convicted drug trafficker)
- "Freeway" Ricky Ross (major Los Angeles dealer, convicted)

**Network:**
- Blandon and Meneses supplied Ross
- Ross distributed through Los Angeles street gangs
- Proceeds allegedly funneled to Contra operations

### Federal Investigations Response

**Three Federal Investigations Triggered by Webb Series:**
1. Department of Justice Inspector General
2. CIA Inspector General (two reports)
3. Congressional inquiries

**Official Conclusions:**
- "No evidence of conspiracy by CIA officials or employees"
- However, CIA IG acknowledged awareness and inaction
- Confirmed failure to investigate or act on allegations
- Confirmed dissuasion of other agencies from investigating

### Media Response Controversy

**Major Newspapers' Response to Webb:**
- Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Washington Post launched investigations
- Rejected Webb's broader conspiracy allegations
- However, researcher Peter Kornbluh noted L.A. Times "stumbled into same problems of hyperbole, selectivity, and credibility"
- Major papers ignored declassified evidence lending credibility to Webb's thesis

**Webb's Fate:**
- Unable to find work at another daily newspaper
- Long bout of depression
- Died December 10, 2004 (apparent suicide)

## Research Notes

### Document Access Strategies

**Immediately Available Online:**
- CIA FOIA Reading Room (searchable database)
- National Security Archive electronic briefing books
- Internet Archive (Tower Commission, Walsh Report, Congressional reports)
- Reagan Library digitized NSDD collection
- Public Intelligence BCCI report

**Requires FOIA/Mandatory Review Request:**
- Oliver North Files (Reagan Library) - use withdrawal sheets to identify specific documents
- Lawrence Walsh records (National Archives) - 1,948 feet of materials, not online
- Classified portions of NIEs
- Operational cables with sensitive sources/methods
- Personnel files

**Available Through University Libraries:**
- Digital National Security Archive (subscription databases)
- ProQuest Congressional Collections
- HathiTrust materials

### Key Research Gaps

**Still Classified/Restricted:**
- Full operational details of Operation Cyclone
- Complete financial records of "The Enterprise"
- Unredacted Battalion 316 documents
- Casey-Abedi meeting records (if they exist in official channels)
- George H.W. Bush's withheld diary entries
- System IV documents that remain classified

**Destroyed/Missing:**
- Oliver North shredded documents (pre-investigation)
- PROFS notes deleted but not backed up
- Some Contra financial records
- Noriega CIA operational files (may exist but restricted)

### Cross-Reference Opportunities

**Drug Trafficking Network Connections:**
- BCCI ← → Noriega ← → Contras ← → Ilopango Airport
- Financial flows through same institutions
- Overlapping personnel and operations
- Timeline correlations (mid-1980s peak)

**Geographic Operation Overlaps:**
- Honduras: Contra base camps + Battalion 316 + Ilopango flights
- Pakistan: Operation Cyclone + BCCI operations + ISI coordination
- Saudi Arabia: Afghan funding + Iran-Contra donations + BCCI shareholding

**Congressional Investigation Links:**
- Kerry Committee: BCCI → drug trafficking → Noriega → Contras
- Iran-Contra Committees: Arms sales → fund diversion → Boland violations
- Senate Intelligence: CIA oversight failures across multiple operations

### Recommended Next Steps for Researchers

1. **FOIA Requests Priority:**
   - Specific Oliver North files from Reagan Library withdrawal sheets
   - Unredacted versions of Honduras Battalion 316 documents
   - Complete Ilopango Airport DEA investigative files
   - Casey calendar and meeting records 1981-1987
   - Additional BCCI-CIA connection documents

2. **Cross-Archive Research:**
   - Correlate Reagan Library NSC meeting dates with CIA operational cables
   - Match Kerry Committee testimony dates with CIA IG investigation timeline
   - Compare State Department Honduras cables with Battalion 316 operations dates

3. **Oral History Projects:**
   - Interviews with surviving participants (many key figures deceased)
   - DEA agents who investigated Ilopango
   - CIA analysts who worked Soviet collapse estimates
   - Congressional staffers from investigations

---

**Document Status:** Research inventory complete - ready for targeted document acquisition
**Estimated Total Documents Identified:** 200+ specific documents, 50+ collections
**Priority Collections:** Iran-Contra (highest volume), BCCI (best financial intelligence nexus), Operation Cyclone (largest operation)
**Next Phase:** Begin systematic download/acquisition of publicly available materials
