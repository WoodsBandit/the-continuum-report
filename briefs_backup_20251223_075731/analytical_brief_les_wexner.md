## Statement of Public Interest

Les Wexner is the billionaire founder of L Brands (Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works) and was **Jeffrey Epstein's** most prominent financial client. The nature and duration of their relationship, including Wexner's granting of power of attorney to Epstein, raises questions of public interest regarding due diligence and financial oversight.

---

## Executive Summary

In our assessment, the Wexner-Epstein relationship represents one of the most unusual financial arrangements in modern business history. Wexner granted Epstein sweeping power of attorney, allowed him to live in a Manhattan mansion owned by Wexner, and entrusted him with management of his personal fortune. Wexner has stated he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after the Florida investigation became public and claims to have been unaware of Epstein's criminal conduct.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our view, the Wexner-Epstein relationship raises significant questions that remain unanswered:

1. **Due Diligence Concerns** — We find it notable that a sophisticated businessman would grant such expansive financial control to an individual with Epstein's limited documented financial background.

2. **Property Transfer** — The circumstances under which the Manhattan townhouse transferred from Wexner to Epstein remain unclear. Wexner's representatives have characterized this differently over time.

3. **Duration of Knowledge** — While Wexner states he severed ties in 2007, the extent of his knowledge prior to that date is, in our assessment, an open question.

We emphasize that Wexner has never been charged with any crime, has denied knowledge of Epstein's conduct, and claims victim status regarding financial misappropriation.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers may reach different conclusions:

- **Victim Interpretation** — Wexner was a victim of Epstein's manipulation and financial fraud, as his representatives have stated. Sophisticated individuals can be deceived by skilled con artists.

- **Willful Blindness Interpretation** — Wexner may have avoided asking questions about Epstein's conduct or income sources. This interpretation does not require knowledge of specific crimes.

- **Pure Business Interpretation** — The relationship was purely financial, Epstein performed legitimate services, and Wexner had no exposure to Epstein's criminal conduct.

Each interpretation has supporting evidence and reasonable adherents.
