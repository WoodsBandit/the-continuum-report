## STEP 4: Configure Windows Firewall

**Option A: GUI Method**
1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**
2. Click **Inbound Rules**
3. Find and enable these rules (set to Private profile):
   - `File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In)`
   - `File and Printer Sharing (NB-Session-In)`

## STEP 5: Get Your Network Info

Open **Command Prompt** and run:
```cmd
ipconfig
```

Find and note your **IPv4 Address** (likely `192.168.1.XXX`)

**Write down these values:**

| Setting | Your Value |
|---------|------------|
| WoodsDen IP | `192.168.1.___` |
| Windows Username | |
| Windows Password | |

---

## STEP 6: Verify the Share Works

1. Press `Win + R` to open Run dialog
2. Type: `\\localhost\claude-docs`
3. Press Enter

**Expected result:** The shared folder opens showing your Claude Docs contents.

## STEP 7: Report Back to Tower

Once complete, tell Claude Code:
```
Share ready. WoodsDen IP is 192.168.1.XXX
Username: [your username]
Password: [your password]
```

Claude Code will then configure the mount on Tower.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Network path not found" | Check Windows Firewall, ensure SMB rules enabled |
| "Access denied" | Verify share permissions include your user with Full Control |
| Can't see in Network | Enable Network Discovery in sharing settings |

---

## SECURITY NOTES

- This share is only accessible on your local network (192.168.1.x)
- Password-protected sharing means credentials are required
- Only enable sharing for Private networks, never Public
- Consider creating a dedicated Windows user for this share
