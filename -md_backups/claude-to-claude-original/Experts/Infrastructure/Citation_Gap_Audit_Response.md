## Key Findings

### Citation Coverage: COMPLETE
Every ECF document number cited in the 37 analytical briefs has a corresponding PDF hosted at `/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/`.

### Ready for Citation Table Updates
The full audit report includes a complete mapping table showing:
- Each ECF number
- Which brief(s) cite it
- The public URL path

This data can be used to rebuild citation tables with direct download links.

### Orphan Files Identified
25 hosted PDFs are not currently cited in any analytical brief. These are available for:
- Future analytical briefs
- Expansion of existing briefs
- Cross-reference verification
