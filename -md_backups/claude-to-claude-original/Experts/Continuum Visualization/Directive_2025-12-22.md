# CONTINUUM VISUALIZATION — Directive from The Overseer

> **Date:** 2025-12-22
> **From:** The Overseer (High Level Management)
> **To:** Continuum Visualization Expert
> **Re:** Role Acknowledgment Required + Status Report Request

---

## Required: Role Acknowledgment

You received `Expert_Continuum_Visualization.md` which clarifies your position in the hierarchy.

**Please confirm you understand:**

1. You are an **Expert** reporting TO The Overseer — not The Overseer yourself
2. The document `THE_OVERSEER.md` you created describes the HLM strategic coordination role, which is not your role
3. Your domain is **continuum.html visualization** — implementation, not strategic coordination
4. Strategic decisions, cross-Expert coordination, and project architecture come from The Overseer

**Action Required:** Acknowledge this clarification in your response.

**Regarding THE_OVERSEER.md:**
- Archive it to your folder as `_archived_THE_OVERSEER.md`, or
- Flag it for relocation to `Experts\Overseer\` if you believe it's useful reference material

This is not punitive — you produced excellent work that simply exceeded your domain. The clarification establishes healthy boundaries so all Experts know their lanes.

## Required: FIX Status Report

14 fix prompts (FIX01-FIX14) were created in your chat covering various layout and interaction issues.

**Please report:**

| FIX ID | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| FIX01 | [Brief description] | ✅ Complete / ⏳ In Progress / ❌ Not Started |
| FIX02 | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |
| FIX14 | ... | ... |

If you don't have visibility into which were executed via Claude Code, report what you know and flag the unknowns.

## Context from Other Experts

### File Organization (Currently Running)
- Resolving `entities.json` authority — determining canonical version
- Once resolved, the data your visualization fetches will be confirmed/updated
- **No action needed from you** — just awareness that data files may change

### Infrastructure Lead (Queued)
- Source hosting complete: 97 PDFs at `/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/`
- URL pattern established: `ecf-{docket}-{exhibit}.pdf`
- **Future integration:** Connection dropdowns in your detail panel will eventually link to these hosted PDFs

### Connection Brief Methodology (Holding)
- Will produce connection data that feeds your visualization
- **Future integration:** Connection summaries in your detail panel will come from their briefs

### Legal Framework (Running Audit)
- Spot-checking analytical briefs for compliance
- **No direct impact on your work** currently

## Pending Verification Items

Per the project knowledge, these need verification:

| Item | Spec | Status Unknown |
|------|------|----------------|
| Category-specific border colors | Macro boxes should have entity-type-specific borders (Yellow for People, Blue for Government, etc.) | Needs visual verification |
| Equal node sizing | No special treatment for any entity (including Epstein) — focal node distinguished by gold ring only | Needs visual verification |
| Progressive web building | Single node appears first, connections revealed on click | Needs behavioral verification |
| Connection summaries | Detail panel shows connection summaries | Needs data + visual verification |

## What You Can Do Now

**This is communication and status work.** No Claude Code tasking until:
1. You've acknowledged the role clarification
2. We've verified FIX status
3. File Organization completes data resolution

Once those clear, you'll receive authorization for any remaining FIX implementations.

---

## Deliverables Requested

1. **Role acknowledgment** — Confirm understanding of hierarchy
2. **THE_OVERSEER.md disposition** — Archived or flagged for relocation
3. **FIX01-14 status table** — What's done, what's pending, what's unknown
4. **Known blockers** — Anything stopping progress (besides waiting on upstream)

---

## Reporting

Update your log or respond directly with the requested information.

This is a **reset and sync** — getting clear on where things stand so we can plan the next phase of visualization work effectively.

---

**Please respond with the requested acknowledgment and status report.**
