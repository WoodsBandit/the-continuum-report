# CONNECTION BRIEF METHODOLOGY — Authorized Directive from The Overseer

> **Date:** 2025-12-22
> **From:** The Overseer (High Level Management)
> **To:** Connection Brief Methodology Expert
> **Re:** Blocker Cleared — Proceed with Priority Matrix

---

## Blocker Status: ✅ CLEARED

File Organization Expert has completed data resolution. You now have:

| Resource | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `entities.json` | `/continuum/data/entities.json` | 15 enriched entities with tags + connections |
| `connections.json` | `/continuum/data/connections.json` | 95 connections (merged) |

**These are now canonical.** No more versioning confusion.

---

## Authorization: Proceed with Priority Matrix

**Task:** Review canonical `entities.json` and create a Connection Brief Priority Matrix

**Purpose:** Establish ranked order for connection brief generation based on:
- Connection count (highest first)
- Evidence level available (Sworn > Documented > Reported > Inferred)
- Cross-category connections (People ↔ Organizations reveal network structure)

---

## Deliverable: Priority Matrix

Create a ranked table:

| Priority | Entity A | Entity B | Relationship Type | Evidence Level | Sources Available |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Jeffrey Epstein | Ghislaine Maxwell | Co-Conspirator | Sworn | Yes (depositions) |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Focus on:** The 15 enriched entities currently in the system.

---

## Context from Other Experts

### File Organization (Just Completed)
- Canonical paths established
- 11 Layer 2+ entities (Robert Maxwell, BCCI, CIA, etc.) are queued for future — NOT in current entities.json
- Your Priority Matrix should cover the 15 entities currently available

### Infrastructure Lead (Running Next)
- Source hosting complete: 97 PDFs at `/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/`
- They're running Citation Gap Audit next — identifies which source docs we have
- Your citation needs will be informed by their audit results

### Legal Framework (Running Audit)
- Spot-checking 3 briefs for compliance
- When you have connection brief template ready, they'll review before generation begins

---

## The Two-Axis System (Your Framework)

**Axis 1: Relationship Types (12)**
- Employer-Employee, Attorney-Client, Family, Financial, Social
- Accuser-Accused, Witness-Subject, Co-Defendant, Co-Conspirator
- Organizational, Proximity, Other

**Axis 2: Evidence Quality (4)**
- Sworn (depositions, affidavits)
- Documented (contracts, logs, filings)
- Reported (news, investigative reports)
- Inferred (pattern analysis, circumstantial)

---

## Work Type

**This is analysis work.** No Claude Code needed initially.

Review the data, build the matrix, report back with:
1. Priority Matrix (top 10-15 connection pairs)
2. Any gaps identified (entities missing connection data)
3. Template confirmation — ready for Legal Framework review?

---

## Reporting

When complete, update your log and notify The Overseer.

If you need Claude Code to extract/analyze the JSON data, you may request a task prompt.

---

**You are cleared to proceed.**
