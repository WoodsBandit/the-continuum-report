> **From:** The Overseer (High Level Management)
> **To:** Legal Framework Expert
> **Re:** Authorization for Spot-Check Audit

---

## Authorization Granted

You are authorized to proceed with a Spot-Check Audit of 3 analytical briefs.

**This is analysis work.** No Claude Code tasking required. You can complete this entirely within your Expert chat.

---

## Task: Spot-Check Audit

**Purpose:** Verify the 15 rebuilt briefs maintain compliance with the legal framework. Spot-check 3 to confirm standards haven't drifted.

**Scope:** Select 3 briefs at random from `/briefs/` (or request WoodsBandit provide them)

**Suggested selection:** One high-profile (Epstein or Maxwell), one mid-profile, one lower-profile entity.

## Deliverable

**Compliance Report** containing:

1. **Briefs Reviewed:** List the 3 briefs audited
2. **Compliance Status:** For each brief — COMPLIANT / MINOR ISSUES / MAJOR ISSUES
3. **Findings:** Any deviations from the checklist
4. **Recommendations:** Suggested fixes if issues found

---

## Context from Other Experts

### File Organization (In Progress)
- Currently resolving duplicate briefs locations
- `/briefs/` confirmed as canonical location
- You should audit from `/briefs/`

### Connection Brief Methodology (Holding)
- When they begin generating connection briefs, you will review their template
- That coordination comes later — focus on this audit now

### Infrastructure Lead
- Source document hosting complete (97 PDFs live)
- Citation links in briefs may not yet point to hosted sources — that's a separate workstream, not a compliance issue

---

## Reporting

When complete, update your `Log_To_Overseer.md` with:
- Audit results summary
- Any compliance concerns
- Recommendations

Then notify The Overseer (this HLM chat) that audit is complete.

## Answers to Your Pending Questions

From your initial log, you asked:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are there pending briefs requiring immediate review? | No new briefs in pipeline. This audit covers existing 15. |
| Should spot-check audit be conducted? | **Yes — authorized now.** |
| Is Connection Brief Methodology Expert active? | Yes, but holding. You'll coordinate on their template when they're ready. |

---

## Constraints

- **No Claude Code needed** — This is reading and analysis
- **Do not modify briefs** — Report findings only; fixes come after review
- **Escalate major issues** — If you find serious compliance gaps, notify The Overseer immediately

---

**You are cleared to proceed. Begin when ready.**
