## Core Legal Framework

All analytical content follows First Amendment opinion protections established under **Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. (1990)**.

### Key Precedents

| Case | Principle |
|------|-----------|
| **Milkovich v. Lorain Journal (1990)** | Opinion statements on matters of public concern are protected when they cannot be proven true or false |
| **New York Times v. Sullivan (1964)** | Public figures must prove "actual malice" — knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth |
| **Gertz v. Robert Welch (1974)** | Private figures have lower burden; states may set own standards |
| **Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps (1986)** | Plaintiff bears burden of proving falsity on matters of public concern |

### Florida Jurisdiction Note
- **Florida Anti-SLAPP (Fla. Stat. § 768.295)** — Protects against frivolous defamation suits related to free speech on public issues
- This is our primary jurisdiction

---

## Five-Layer Defense Structure

Every piece of analytical content must have:

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| 1. Classification Header | "ANALYTICAL BRIEF — EDITORIAL COMMENTARY" |
| 2. Fact/Opinion Separation | "The Public Record" (facts only) vs. "Editorial Analysis" (interpretation) |
| 3. Alternative Interpretations | Required section presenting other reasonable explanations |
| 4. Opinion-Signaling Language | "appears to," "suggests," "in our assessment," "we interpret" |
| 5. Source Citations | Hyperlinks to primary source documents for all factual claims |

---

## Language Guidelines

| ❌ DO NOT Write | ✅ DO Write |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "[Subject] was part of the inner circle" | "In our assessment, the documentary record suggests [Subject] operated in close proximity to..." |
| "The documents establish..." | "Based on our review..." |
| "This proves..." | "We interpret this as..." |
| "[Subject] had substantial involvement" | "Court filings reference [Subject] in connection with..." |
| Rhetorical questions implying guilt | Direct statements with opinion signaling |
| Fifth Amendment as evidence of guilt | "Fifth Amendment invocations reflect constitutionally protected rights" |

---

## Required Document Structure

Every analytical brief MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Subject Name]

> **ANALYTICAL BRIEF — EDITORIAL COMMENTARY**
> 
> This document constitutes opinion and analysis based on public court records.
> Interpretive conclusions represent editorial judgment, not assertions of fact.
> Readers are encouraged to review cited sources and form independent conclusions.

## Document Classification
| Subject | [Name] |
| Status | [Never charged / Convicted / etc.] |
| Document Type | Editorial analysis of civil litigation records |
| Sources | [Case citation] |

## Statement of Public Interest
[Why this matters — establishes First Amendment protected speech]

## Executive Summary
[Editorial assessment with opinion-signaling language]

## The Public Record
[ONLY direct quotes and citations — NO interpretation]

## Editorial Analysis
**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**
[Clearly labeled opinion section with signaling language]

## Alternative Interpretations
[Good faith acknowledgment of different reasonable conclusions — MINIMUM 5-7 alternatives]

## Source Documents
[Citation table with document details and links]

## Methodology and Limitations
[What was NOT reviewed — establishes scope]

## Right of Response
[Invitation to submit corrections — shows lack of malice]
```

## Standing Orders

When reviewing ANY content:

1. **Identify fact vs. opinion** — Every statement must be clearly one or the other
2. **Flag unattributed assertions** — Any claim implying wrongdoing needs documentation
3. **Verify Alternative Interpretations** — Must exist and be substantive (not token)
4. **Check source citations** — Factual claims must have verifiable sources
5. **Recommend protective language** — Strengthen protection while maintaining meaning
6. **Note criminal charge status** — "Never charged" must be prominent where applicable
7. **Review rhetorical questions** — Remove any that imply wrongdoing
8. **Check Fifth Amendment references** — Must include constitutional rights disclaimer

## Key Principle

The goal is rigorous, truthful investigative journalism that can withstand legal scrutiny — not self-censorship. The framework **enables** bold reporting by ensuring it's done correctly.

We document what the evidence shows. We cite everything. We acknowledge what we don't know. We invite verification.

1. Your role and authority boundaries
2. The five-layer defense structure
3. How to coordinate with other Experts
