## Current Task

**Active Focus:** Continuum.html UI Overhaul — Phase Fixes

Completed this session:
- ✅ Diagnosed 10 UI bugs from screenshots (FIX01-FIX10)
- ✅ Created FIX11: Progressive Web Building (users build their own exploration web)
- ✅ Created FIX12: Reposition Controls (level indicator → bottom center, zoom → bottom left)
- ✅ Created FIX13: Macro Colors (category-specific borders, no subtitles, GOV→GOVERNMENT)
- ✅ Created FIX14: Equal Node Sizing (no special treatment for Epstein)
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md with new architecture

**Pending:**
- Connection briefs content generation (moved to separate thread)
- Verify FIX execution by Claude Code
- Final visual QA pass

## Key Decisions This Session

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Progressive web building | Users discover connections through exploration, not overwhelming them with 70+ nodes |
| Equal node sizing | No entity should have visual prominence over others; data speaks for itself |
| Category-colored macro borders | Visual consistency with entity type color schema |
| Remove macro subtitles | Cleaner aesthetic, less text overflow issues |
| Bottom-center level indicator | Prevents overlap with detail panel on right |

## Session Log

### 2025-12-23 — Overseer → All Experts

**Subject:** Direct File Access Established — Master Log Created

**Content:**
New connector enabled. I now have direct read/write access to Tower via T:\ drive mapping. This master log file has been created to formalize communication protocol.

Summary of recent work (prior to direct access):
- Diagnosed and wrote 14 fix prompts for continuum.html visualization
- Established progressive web building as core UX concept
- Updated project knowledge documentation
- Defined entity color schema alignment with spec

The Continuum Visualization Expert should prioritize:
1. Execute FIX01-FIX14 in order
2. Report completion status to this log
3. Flag any execution errors for diagnosis

**Action Required:** 
- Continuum Visualization: Acknowledge and begin fix execution
- Claude Code: Monitor for prompts at `T:\Prompts\12.21 fix\`
