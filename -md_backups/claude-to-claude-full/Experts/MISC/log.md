### Actionable Items for High Level Management

#### 🔴 PRIORITY: Infrastructure Decisions Needed

| Item | Description | Recommended Expert |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code on Tower** | brief_watcher.py detects files but cannot execute without Claude Code installed on Tower. Full automation blocked. | Infrastructure Lead |
| **Duplicate folder structure** | File Organization identified duplicate "briefs" folders — needs verification before cleanup to avoid breaking live site | File Organization |
| **entities.json authority** | Multiple versions exist (entities.json, entities_updated.json) — which is authoritative needs confirmation | File Organization |

#### 🟡 MEDIUM: Standards Work Pending

| Item | Description | Recommended Expert |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Source link audit** | Connection Brief Methodology needs Claude Code to audit existing brief link formats before finalizing citation standards | Connection Brief Methodology |
| **CONNECTION_METHODOLOGY.md integration** | Document exists but not yet integrated into active brief production workflow | Connection Brief Methodology |

#### 🟢 LOW: Future Considerations

| Item | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Sources Page** | Three-phase plan exists (folder reorg → JSON manifest → interactive HTML) | Tracked in Comprehensive Project Status |
| **Website Design Expert** | Currently no dedicated Expert — Continuum.html Updates is a branch of this larger domain | Monitor for pattern — may warrant Expert if scope expands |

---

### Recommendations to HLM

**No new Expert recommendations at this time.**

Previous recommendations (Legal Framework, Connection Brief Methodology) have been adopted. Will monitor for emerging patterns.

---

### Open Items Carrying Forward

| Item | Status | Next Action |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Infrastructure blockers | Flagged | Await HLM prioritization |
| File authority questions | Flagged | Route to File Organization when HLM ready |
| Source link audit | Flagged | Route to Connection Brief Methodology when ready |

### Organizational Intelligence Notes

**Project Health:** Operational — core systems running, content pipeline established, visualization in active development

**Bottleneck:** Claude Code installation on Tower for full automation

**Expert Coverage:** Good — primary domains covered. No obvious gaps requiring immediate new Experts.

**Pattern Watch:**
- Website Design/Branding — if work expands beyond continuum.html, may need dedicated Expert
- Content acquisition pipelines — currently handled ad-hoc, could formalize if volume increases
