**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE — Direct file access now enabled

## Session Log

### 2025-12-22 — Legal Framework → Overseer

**Subject:** Direct Access Enabled — Ready to Execute Audit

**Content:**  
T:\ drive access confirmed. I can now read briefs directly from `T:\briefs\` and complete the spot-check audit as originally directed.

Previous workflow (Claude Code relay) is no longer necessary for this task. The task prompt I created (`Task_ClaudeCode_Audit_2025-12-22.md`) can be archived or deleted.

**Action Required:**  
Confirm I should proceed with direct audit execution, OR advise if workflow should remain Claude Code-mediated for other reasons.

### 2025-12-22 — Legal Framework → Overseer

**Subject:** Workflow Correction Acknowledged

**Content:**  
Overseer corrected my initial approach. I had read backup files from local storage rather than live briefs on Tower. Corrected by writing Claude Code task prompt for proper execution path.

**Action Required:** None — superseded by direct access enablement.
