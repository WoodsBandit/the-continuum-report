when you click je network on networks page what should you see in entities page; only the Jeffery Epstein node, then only open nodes to view on screen once you've click from the connections panel on the side or if you search at the top and click from the drop down you can make a node appear.



*needs more structure. first node should be at the top and things work down from there still able to place how you want.

Macro Tab:
not crazy about colors

People 
every person in the continuum (index of everyone involved) index list of people

Gov
everything governmental - intelligence networks - government people - three letter agencies - foreign agencies


Media
every media company - people in media

Financial
every financial company - people in financial


the networks should "touch" the The Continuum circle physical or with lines whatever looks pretty, clean up the colors, don't show a color legend at the bottom.

things can have multiples tags and exist in multiple sections.


Networks level:
once you click into a network. ONly show the different networks with the tag of what you clicked in macro

Entities level:

only show the node that you clicked on in the networks tab. exploring from there with reading the brief and clicking a node from connections. 
somewhere we need an explanation of the connection.pop up and explain the connection when you click on the connection in the tab with source documents avalible. 
dont need "documented" "associated" or "referenced" in connections, just need a clear explaination when clicked of how they are connected.

cases should not be their own node, but the full brief should be accessable within each node they are attached to.
