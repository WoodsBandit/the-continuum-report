## Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell

Prince Andrew's association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell spans multiple decades. Court documents from *Giuffre v. Maxwell* reveal that Prince Andrew was among a select group of individuals whose communications with Maxwell were specifically sought in discovery.

According to ECF Doc. 1327-12 (filed 01/05/24), Maxwell's First Request for Production responses stated that Giuffre's requests "sought, inter alia: all communications with thirteen specific witnesses, namely Jeffrey Epstein, Virginia Roberts, Prince Andrew, Ross Gow, Alan Dershowitz, Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Glenn and Eva Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcincova and Bill and Hillary Clinton."

The specificity of this request - limiting to just thirteen individuals out of potentially hundreds of witnesses - indicates Prince Andrew's central importance to Giuffre's allegations against Maxwell. The document further notes that Maxwell's defense team conducted comprehensive forensic searches of electronic devices and email accounts using "Prince Andrew" as a search term.

## Allegations by Virginia Giuffre

Virginia Giuffre's allegations against Prince Andrew emerged publicly through her civil defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell (*Giuffre v. Maxwell*, Case No. 15-cv-07433-LAP). The litigation revealed detailed allegations about Prince Andrew's involvement with Epstein's alleged trafficking operation.

### Nature of the Allegations

Giuffre alleged that:
- She was approximately 17 years old when she was directed to engage in sexual acts with Prince Andrew
- The encounters occurred at multiple locations, including:
  - Ghislaine Maxwell's residence in London
  - Jeffrey Epstein's mansion in New York
  - Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands
- She was coerced and trafficked for these purposes by Epstein and Maxwell
- Maxwell personally orchestrated and facilitated these encounters

### Discovery Litigation

The discovery process in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* involved extensive disputes over documents related to Prince Andrew. Maxwell's counsel was ordered to conduct forensic examination of electronic devices to search for communications involving Prince Andrew and other key witnesses.

According to Maxwell's submission regarding search terms (ECF Doc. 1327-12, filed 01/05/24), the defense team:
- Forensically imaged hard drives of Maxwell's devices
- Imaged servers containing emails from Maxwell's personal and business accounts
- Ran comprehensive searches using "Prince Andrew" among other search terms
- Reviewed all results for responsive, non-privileged documents

In email correspondence between counsel (ECF Doc. 1327-14, filed 01/05/24), Maxwell's attorney Laura Menninger distinguished Prince Andrew from hundreds of other proposed witness names, noting he was among a limited group "for whom Giuffre had specifically requested all communications." The correspondence stated: "There are some RFPs which identify individual witnesses whose communications with our client you sought (e.g., 1 – Epstein, 2, -Plaintiff, 3-Prince Andrew Kellen, Dubins, Brunel and Marcincova, 17-Gow, 37-Clintons)."

## The Famous Photograph

One of the most significant pieces of evidence in the public discourse surrounding Prince Andrew's connection to the Epstein scandal is a photograph showing Prince Andrew with his arm around Virginia Giuffre's waist, with Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background. The photograph purportedly was taken at Maxwell's London residence in 2001, when Giuffre was 17 years old.

The photograph became central to public scrutiny of Prince Andrew's denials. In his November 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew:
- Questioned whether the photograph was genuine
- Suggested it might have been altered or faked
- Claimed he had "no recollection" of the photograph being taken
- Stated he had no recollection of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre

Photographic experts who examined the image found no evidence of manipulation. The photograph has been widely circulated in media coverage and referenced in legal proceedings, though its specific evidentiary use in court filings remains part of sealed or settled aspects of litigation.

## Civil Lawsuit and Settlement

### *Giuffre v. Prince Andrew* (2021-2022)

On August 9, 2021, Virginia Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging sexual abuse under the New York Child Victims Act. The complaint asserted three causes of action:

1. **Battery** - alleging Prince Andrew engaged in sexual acts with Giuffre without her consent when she was a minor
2. **Assault** - alleging Prince Andrew committed assault by intentionally causing harmful and offensive contact
3. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress** - alleging Prince Andrew's conduct was extreme and outrageous

The lawsuit specifically alleged that Prince Andrew sexually abused Giuffre on three separate occasions when she was under 18 years old.

### Motion to Dismiss

Prince Andrew's legal team filed a motion to dismiss the case on multiple grounds:

1. **Lack of Jurisdiction** - arguing Giuffre was not a U.S. resident and therefore lacked standing to sue in U.S. courts
2. **Release Agreement** - arguing a 2009 settlement agreement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein released Prince Andrew and other "potential defendants" from liability
3. **Statute of Limitations** - arguing the claims were time-barred

On January 12, 2022, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan denied the motion to dismiss, ruling that:
- The release agreement's language was ambiguous regarding whether Prince Andrew was covered
- Giuffre had adequately alleged her residency in Colorado
- The New York Child Victims Act provided a viable pathway for the claims to proceed

The denial meant the case would proceed to discovery, potentially requiring Prince Andrew to sit for depositions and produce documents.

### Settlement

On February 15, 2022, just weeks after Judge Kaplan's ruling and before discovery commenced, the parties announced they had reached an out-of-court settlement. According to the joint filing:

- Prince Andrew agreed to make a "substantial donation" to Giuffre's charity supporting victims' rights
- Prince Andrew acknowledged that "Ms. Giuffre has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks"
- Prince Andrew stated he "never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character"
- Prince Andrew expressed regret for his association with Jeffrey Epstein
- The parties requested dismissal of the case

**Critical Aspects:**
- The settlement contained **no admission of liability** by Prince Andrew
- The financial terms were not publicly disclosed (reports estimated £7-12 million)
- Prince Andrew continued to deny the allegations
- The settlement prevented the case from going to trial or even reaching discovery

### Consequences

Following the lawsuit and settlement:

- **January 13, 2022**: Buckingham Palace announced Prince Andrew would be stripped of his military titles and royal patronages
- He was no longer permitted to use the style "His Royal Highness" in any official capacity
- He effectively withdrew from public life and all royal duties
- His reputation suffered severe and likely permanent damage
- The settlement is widely viewed as one of the most significant scandals in modern British Royal Family history

## Context from *Giuffre v. Maxwell* Litigation

Much of the public information about Prince Andrew's alleged involvement emerged from the defamation case *Giuffre v. Maxwell* (Case No. 15-cv-07433-LAP, S.D.N.Y.), filed in 2015. That case involved Virginia Giuffre suing Ghislaine Maxwell for defamation after Maxwell publicly denied Giuffre's allegations.

### Epstein's Fifth Amendment Invocation

Jeffrey Epstein was subpoenaed to testify at trial in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case but sought to quash the subpoena. According to Epstein's Motion to Quash Trial Subpoena (ECF Doc. 1331-36, filed 01/05/24):

- Epstein was deposed on November 10, 2016
- During that deposition, "he asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to answer all substantive questions"
- The court ruled that Epstein's assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege was "valid and proper"
- Epstein stated it was his "intention, if he is called as a witness at the trial of this case, to once again assert his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to questioning"

The motion noted that Epstein was asked "approximately 600 separate questions, to all of which Mr. Epstein asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege." This sweeping invocation prevented any testimony from Epstein about Prince Andrew, Maxwell, or the alleged trafficking operation.

### Electronic Discovery

The discovery disputes in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* provide insight into the scope of Prince Andrew's alleged involvement. According to Defendant's Submission Regarding Search Terms (ECF Doc. 1327-12, filed 01/05/24):

**First Requests for Production (February 2016)** sought:
- All communications with thirteen specific witnesses, including Prince Andrew
- Documents relating to travel records
- Photos of females under age 18
- Photos of any time inside a home or aircraft of Epstein
- Documents relating to massages
- Documents relating to Maxwell's professional affiliation with Epstein

**Forensic Search Process**:
- Maxwell's counsel conducted a "thorough search of her email systems and her devices prior to her production on February 8, 2016"
- Forensic imaging of hard drives was later ordered by the court
- Search terms included "Prince Andrew" among 110 initially agreed terms
- An additional 66 search terms were later proposed and run
- According to the defense submission: "not one single additional responsive and non-privileged document has been identified"

The document characterized the forensic searches as a "costly, time-consuming and burdensome wild goose chase that has yielded not so much as a single goose feather."

In correspondence (ECF Doc. 1327-14, filed 01/05/24), Maxwell's attorney specifically addressed searches for Prince Andrew, distinguishing him from hundreds of other witness names: "There are some RFPs which identify individual witnesses whose communications with our client you sought (e.g., 1 – Epstein, 2, -Plaintiff, 3-Prince Andrew Kellen, Dubins, Brunel and Marcincova, 17-Gow, 37-Clintons)."

## Public Statements and Denials

Prince Andrew consistently and categorically denied Virginia Giuffre's allegations from the time they became public through the settlement of her lawsuit against him.

### The BBC Newsnight Interview (November 2019)

Prince Andrew's most significant public statement came in a November 16, 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis. During the interview, Prince Andrew:

**Denied the Allegations:**
- Stated he had "no recollection" of meeting Virginia Giuffre
- Denied having any sexual contact with her
- Denied the encounter at Tramp nightclub in London that Giuffre described

**Challenged the Photograph:**
- Questioned whether the famous photograph was genuine
- Suggested it might have been doctored or faked
- Could not explain how the photograph came to exist if it were authentic

**Offered Specific Alibis:**
- Claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter on March 10, 2001 (one of the dates Giuffre alleged an encounter)
- Said he remembered the Pizza Express visit specifically because "going to Pizza Express in Woking is a very unusual thing for me to do"

**Medical Claims:**
- Addressed Giuffre's statement that he was sweating profusely at Tramp nightclub
- Claimed he had a medical condition stemming from being shot at during the Falklands War that prevented him from sweating
- Later acknowledged this condition had since resolved

**Epstein Relationship:**
- Acknowledged his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein
- Admitted visiting Epstein in New York in 2010 after Epstein's 2008 conviction (photographed walking in Central Park with Epstein)
- Claimed the 2010 visit was to formally end the friendship
- Expressed regret for continuing the association after Epstein's conviction

### Public Reaction

The BBC Newsnight interview is widely considered one of the most damaging public relations disasters in modern royal history:

- Prince Andrew's explanations (particularly the Pizza Express alibi and medical condition claims) were met with widespread skepticism
- His apparent lack of empathy for Epstein's victims drew criticism
- Multiple organizations severed ties with his charitable foundations following the interview
- The interview is credited with accelerating his removal from public life

### Official Palace Statements

Through Buckingham Palace and legal representatives, Prince Andrew maintained:
- He had no witness to or knowledge of criminal behavior by Epstein during their association
- His relationship with Epstein was primarily facilitated through Ghislaine Maxwell
- He regretted his continued association with Epstein after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor
- The allegations against him were "false and without foundation"

## Analysis and Implications

### Legal Significance of the Settlement

The February 2022 settlement between Giuffre and Prince Andrew resolved the legal claims without establishing any facts in a court of law. However, the circumstances merit analysis:

**Timing:**
- The settlement came immediately after Judge Kaplan denied the motion to dismiss
- Prince Andrew would have faced discovery, including depositions under oath
- He would have been required to produce documents and communications
- The decision to settle before discovery suggests a desire to avoid this process

**Financial Terms:**
- While undisclosed, credible reports placed the settlement in the range of £7-12 million
- Prince Andrew reportedly financed the settlement with assistance from Queen Elizabeth II
- The substantial sum, combined with a charitable donation, indicates significant incentive to resolve the matter

**Public Acknowledgments:**
- Prince Andrew's acknowledgment that Giuffre "suffered as an established victim of abuse and trafficking" represented a softening from absolute denials
- His expression of "regret" for his association with Epstein, while not an admission, marked a shift in tone
- However, the settlement contained no admission of liability or wrongdoing

### Evidentiary Considerations

The public record contains limited direct evidence regarding Prince Andrew's alleged conduct:

**Evidence Supporting Giuffre's Account:**
- The photograph showing Prince Andrew with his arm around Giuffre, with Maxwell present
- Giuffre's detailed and consistent testimony over many years
- Documented association between Prince Andrew, Epstein, and Maxwell
- Prince Andrew's acknowledged presence at locations where encounters allegedly occurred

**Limitations:**
- No other alleged victims have publicly accused Prince Andrew
- Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment, providing no testimony
- Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking but not specifically in connection with Prince Andrew
- The case settled before discovery, so no additional documentary evidence entered the public record
- Prince Andrew's denials remain unrefuted by trial evidence

### Reputational and Institutional Impact

**For the British Royal Family:**
- The scandal represents one of the most serious crises for the monarchy in recent decades
- It came during a period of existing scrutiny following other royal controversies
- The stripping of titles and patronages was unprecedented in modern royal history
- Prince Andrew's effective exile from public life represents a permanent stain on the institution

**For Victims' Rights:**
- Giuffre's willingness to pursue civil claims against a royal demonstrated the courage of trafficking victims
- The case showed that powerful individuals can be held accountable in civil courts
- The settlement, while not a trial victory, represented a form of public acknowledgment

**For Public Accountability:**
- The case demonstrated that royal status does not provide immunity from U.S. civil liability
- It highlighted the role of civil litigation in addressing allegations that fall outside criminal prosecution
- However, the settlement also demonstrated how wealth can be used to avoid public trial

### Unanswered Questions

Because the case settled without trial and without discovery, many questions remain unanswered:

- **The full extent of Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell**: How frequently did they interact? Over what time period? In what contexts?
- **Prince Andrew's knowledge of Epstein's conduct**: What did he know or suspect about Epstein's alleged trafficking? When did he know it?
- **Additional evidence**: Are there other photographs, communications, or witnesses that were never made public?
- **Other potential victims**: Did Prince Andrew have inappropriate contact with other young women in Epstein's orbit?
- **The photograph's context**: Where exactly was it taken? Who took it? Under what circumstances?

The settlement ensured these questions would not be examined through the adversarial process of litigation, leaving the historical record incomplete.

## Conclusion

Prince Andrew's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal represents a watershed moment in both the broader Epstein case and modern British royal history. Virginia Giuffre's allegations, first made public in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* defamation litigation and later pursued through direct civil action against Prince Andrew, led to his effective removal from public life and permanent damage to his reputation.

The court record from *Giuffre v. Maxwell* reveals that Prince Andrew was among a select group of individuals whose communications with Maxwell were specifically and repeatedly sought in discovery - suggesting his central importance to Giuffre's allegations. The forensic searches of Maxwell's electronic devices for "Prince Andrew" communications, the specific requests for production, and the extensive discovery litigation all point to his significant role in the alleged trafficking operation.

The February 2022 settlement of *Giuffre v. Prince Andrew* resolved the legal claims without trial, meaning the allegations were never tested in court and Prince Andrew made no admission of wrongdoing. However, the circumstances of the settlement - its timing immediately after the motion to dismiss was denied, its reportedly substantial financial terms, and Prince Andrew's acknowledgment of Giuffre as a trafficking victim - are significant.

The consequences for Prince Andrew have been severe and permanent: stripped of military titles and royal patronages, barred from using "His Royal Highness," and effectively exiled from public life. For the British Royal Family, the scandal represents one of the most serious reputational crises in modern history.

For Virginia Giuffre and other trafficking victims, the case demonstrated that even members of royal families can be held civilly accountable in U.S. courts, though the settlement also illustrated how wealth can be used to avoid public trial.

The full truth of Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell, the accuracy of Giuffre's specific allegations, and the answers to many other questions remain matters of public debate rather than established legal fact. The settlement ensured privacy for both parties but left the historical record incomplete. What is clear from the court documents is that Virginia Giuffre made specific, detailed, and consistent allegations over many years, and that Prince Andrew chose to settle those claims rather than proceed to discovery and trial.
