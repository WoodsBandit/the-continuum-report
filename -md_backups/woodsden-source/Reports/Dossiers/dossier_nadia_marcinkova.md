## Executive Summary

Nadia Marcinkova appears in court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation (Case No. 15-cv-07433-LAP). According to victim testimony and court filings, Marcinkova was allegedly a participant in Jeffrey Epstein's operation. Multiple victims have provided sworn testimony alleging Marcinkova's involvement in sexual activities. Flight logs place Marcinkova on Epstein's private aircraft traveling to his private island. When deposed in civil proceedings, Marcinkova invoked Fifth Amendment privileges on substantive questions regarding her relationship with Epstein and his activities.

## Flight Log Appearances

Court filings include flight logs showing Marcinkova's travel on Epstein's private aircraft.

**ECF Doc. 1331-12** (filed 01/05/24), pp. 2:

Flight records referenced in this document show:

> "On December 14, 2006 (Flight #1920), Sarah Ransome flew from TIST (USVI) to EWR (Newark, NJ) with Jeffrey Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova. See Giuffre 07139."

The same document notes an earlier flight on December 10, 2006 (Flight #1919), where:

> "Sarah Ransome flew from EWR (Newark, NJ) to TIST (USVI) with Jeffrey Epstein, Jennifer Kalin, and Natalya Malyshev."

This placement on flights to and from Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (TIST) establishes Marcinkova's presence at locations central to the alleged trafficking operation during the same timeframe when alleged victims report being at the island.

## Allegations from Victim Testimony

### Sarah Ransome Affidavit - Sexual Activities with Minor and Adult Females

**Note on Ransome's Age:** Sarah Ransome states she was 22 years old in summer 2006 when introduced to Epstein, making her an adult at the time of the events she describes. Her testimony is nevertheless relevant as it describes observing other young girls who appeared to be minors, and it describes Marcinkova's alleged participation in sexual activities.



**ECF Doc. 1331-12** (filed 01/05/24), pp. 8-9, **ECF Doc. 1331-32** (filed 01/05/24), pp. 2-3:

Sarah Ransome provided a sworn affidavit dated January 5, 2017, describing Marcinkova's alleged role. The affidavit contains the following allegations:

**Paragraph 2:**

> "In the summer of 2006, when I was twenty-two years old and living in New York, I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein by a girl I had met named Natalya. Malyshov. Shortly after meeting Jeffrey he invited me to fly to his private island in the US Virgin Islands, which I did. After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction... As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, **Nadia Macinkova**, and various other girls and guests he brought to the island."

**Paragraph 4:**

> "In addition to spending time with Jeffrey on his island, I spent time with him in New York City. At his town house I was also lent out by him to his friends and associates to have sex. Among the people he lent me to was his friend, Alan Dershowitz. On one occasion I was in a bedroom at Jeffrey's New York townhouse with Jeffrey and **Nadia Marcinkova**. After a short time, Alan Dershowitz entered the room, after which Jeffrey left the room and **Nadia and I had sex with Dershowitz**. I recall specific, key details of his person and the sex acts and can describe them in the event it becomes necessary to do so."

**Paragraph 3 - Observations of Young Girls:**

Ransome's affidavit also describes the broader context on Epstein's island:

> "During one of my visits to the island I met Ghislaine Maxwell. Watching her interact with the other girls on the island, it became clear to me that she recruited all or many of them to the island. Once they were there, she appeared to be in charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with, and how they were supposed to stay in line. She assumed the same supervisory role with me as soon as I arrived. **Some of the girls appeared to be 18 or older, but many appeared to be young teenagers.** I recall seeing a particularly young, thin girl who looked well under 18 and recall asking her her age. I later learned was a ballerina. She refused to tell me or let me see her passport."

This testimony places both Maxwell and Marcinkova on the island during a period when, according to Ransome, underage girls were present.

The affidavit was executed on January 5, 2017, in Barcelona, Spain, before Hsiao-Ching Chang, Vice Consul of the United States of America, and authenticated with the official seal of the U.S. Consulate General.

## Fifth Amendment Invocations and Deposition Conduct

**ECF Doc. 1331-13** (filed 01/05/24), p. 15:

Court filings indicate that when Marcinkova was deposed in the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation, she invoked Fifth Amendment privileges. From plaintiff's opposition brief titled "Plaintiff Giuffre's Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion in Limine to Exclude in Toto Certain Depositions Designated by Plaintiff for Use at Trial":

> "Ms. Giuffre has diligently sought out other witnesses, but no other witnesses she can call can provide the testimony that Mr. Rodriguez will provide. In stark contrast, Mr. Rodriguez was more than willing to testify... Ms. Giuffre took the depositions of Sarah Kellen and **Nadia Marcinkova**. Again, **they both took the Fifth on all substantive questions**."

This pattern—invoking Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination when questioned about Epstein-related activities—appears consistently across depositions of the four named co-conspirators: Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, Adriana Ross, and Lesley Groff.

**Legal Context:**

While taking the Fifth is a constitutional right and cannot be used as evidence of guilt in criminal proceedings, in civil cases courts may permit adverse inferences from the invocation depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. The document suggests plaintiff's counsel sought to use these depositions at trial despite the invocations, though defendant moved to exclude them.

The contrast drawn with Alfredo Rodriguez—Epstein's former house manager who testified before his death—highlights the significance of the refusals: Rodriguez provided substantive testimony about activities inside Epstein's Palm Beach mansion during the 2005 timeframe, while the four named co-conspirators declined to testify about the same period and location.

## Named Co-Conspirator Status

Court documents from earlier Epstein proceedings reportedly identified Marcinkova among other individuals designated as unindicted co-conspirators. This designation originated in the 2008 Florida prosecution that resulted in Epstein's controversial non-prosecution agreement.

The category "co-conspirator" in that context did not result in charges, but the designation appears in civil litigation records discussing individuals allegedly involved in facilitating Epstein's activities.

---

## Context: Relationship to Epstein's Alleged Operation

Court records from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case depict Marcinkova as part of an inner circle that included:

- **Sarah Kellen** - Described as Epstein's assistant/scheduler
- **Adriana Ross** (formerly Mucinska) - Another assistant who appears in testimony
- **Lesley Groff** - New York office assistant
- **Nadia Marcinkova** - The subject of this dossier

These individuals appear repeatedly in:
- Victim testimony describing the mechanics of scheduling and facilitating
- Flight logs showing travel to Epstein properties
- Deposition records where Fifth Amendment privileges were invoked

The pattern across these individuals suggests what plaintiffs characterized as an organizational structure enabling Epstein's activities.

## Origins and Recruitment

Court documents reviewed for this dossier do not contain detailed information about Marcinkova's origins or how she came to be associated with Epstein. Earlier media reports have referenced allegations that Epstein brought Marcinkova from Eastern Europe at a young age, but such claims do not appear in the specific court filings examined here.

**This represents a gap in the documentary record available for this dossier.** Further research into depositions, investigative journalism sources, or other court proceedings may contain additional detail.

---

## Biographical Information

### Known Details

Limited biographical information about Marcinkova appears in the court documents examined for this dossier. The documents establish her presence in Epstein's orbit during the mid-2000s but do not provide comprehensive background details.

### Subsequent Activities

Court documents reviewed for this dossier do not address Marcinkova's activities after the 2008 timeframe. Information about her post-2008 life, professional activities, or current whereabouts would require sources beyond the litigation documents examined here.

## Evidentiary Assessment

**Strength of Sources:**

1. **Flight Logs** - Documentary evidence, difficult to dispute when properly authenticated
2. **Sworn Affidavits** (Ransome) - Testimony under penalty of perjury, consular-notarized
3. **Court Filings** - Statements made by attorneys in litigation, subject to professional responsibility rules
4. **Fifth Amendment Invocations** - Documented refusal to testify, legally protected but potentially relevant in civil context

**Limitations:**

- No criminal charges have been filed against Marcinkova
- Fifth Amendment invocations do not constitute admissions
- Allegations in civil litigation are not established facts
- Limited information about Marcinkova's own account or circumstances

**What This Dossier Cannot Establish:**

- Whether Marcinkova was herself a victim
- The precise nature of her relationship with Epstein
- Whether she faced coercion or operated with agency
- Her current activities or whereabouts

These questions remain open and would require additional evidence, potentially including Marcinkova's own testimony if she chose to provide it.

---

## Analytical Commentary

The documentary record presents a complex picture. If the allegations in sworn testimony are accurate, Marcinkova's role evolved from someone potentially brought into Epstein's orbit at a young age to someone who participated in activities with other young women.

This raises difficult questions about victimization versus perpetration—categories that may not be mutually exclusive. The invocation of Fifth Amendment privileges suggests legal exposure, but without knowing what Marcinkova might have said if testifying, interpretation remains speculative.

The absence of criminal charges against Marcinkova—despite her identification as a co-conspirator in the 2008 proceedings—may reflect prosecutorial decisions, evidentiary limitations, or the controversial nature of the non-prosecution agreement itself.
