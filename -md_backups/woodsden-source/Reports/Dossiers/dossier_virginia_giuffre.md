## Role as Plaintiff and Alleged Victim

### The Defamation Case: Giuffre v. Maxwell

Virginia Giuffre filed a defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell in 2015 (Case No. 15-cv-07433-RWS, S.D.N.Y.). The case centered on Maxwell's public statements calling Giuffre's allegations "obvious lies" in a January 2, 2015 press release. The litigation involved extensive discovery disputes, multiple depositions, and contentious motions practice.

**Key Aspects of Plaintiff Role:**

- **Legal Representation**: Giuffre was represented by Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP (attorneys Sigrid McCawley, Meredith Schultz, and David Boies), Farmer, Jaffe, Weissing, Edwards, Fistos & Lehrman, P.L. (Bradley J. Edwards), Paul G. Cassell (S.J. Quinney College of Law, University of Utah), and J. Stanley Pottinger. (ECF Doc. 1331-19, filed 01/05/24)

- **Discovery Battles**: The case featured significant discovery disputes, including:
  - Motion to compel Maxwell to produce documents (ECF Doc. 1327-19, filed 01/05/24)
  - Motion for adverse inference instruction based on alleged spoliation and discovery violations
  - Motion to compel Maxwell to answer deposition questions (ECF Doc. 1320-6, filed 01/03/24)
  - Motion to compel work product and attorney-client communications with Philip Barden (ECF Doc. 1331-19)

- **Deposition Testimony**: Giuffre sat for deposition on May 3, 2016. Maxwell's attorneys later moved to reopen the deposition based on subsequently disclosed medical records and alleged inconsistencies. (ECF Doc. 1320-36, filed 01/03/24)

---

## Recruitment Allegations

According to pleadings in *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, Giuffre alleges the following recruitment scenario:

- **Location**: Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida
- **Age at Recruitment**: 16 or 17 years old
- **Initial Employment**: Working at Mar-a-Lago
- **Alleged Recruiter**: Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly approached Giuffre and recruited her to give "massages" to Jeffrey Epstein
- **Nature of Work**: Giuffre alleges the "massages" were of a sexual nature and that she was trafficked to other men

**Maxwell's Denial**: Court filings show Maxwell denied these allegations, asserting she "never arranged for or asked [Giuffre] to have sex with anyone." (ECF Doc. 1320-6, filed 01/03/24)

---

## Depositions and Testimony

### May 3, 2016 Deposition

Giuffre's deposition in the Maxwell defamation case became a subject of significant subsequent litigation:

- **Initial Deposition**: Conducted on May 3, 2016, designated as Confidential under the Protective Order
- **Errata Sheet**: Giuffre served an errata sheet on June 1, 2016, making changes to her deposition testimony
- **Motion to Reopen**: Maxwell moved to reopen Giuffre's deposition based on:
  - Medical records produced after the deposition (May 12, May 25, and June 1, 2016)
  - Deposition of Giuffre's therapist Lynn Trude Miller (May 24, 2016)
  - Deposition of Dr. Steven Olsen (May 26, 2016)
  - Alleged inconsistencies between testimony and medical records

(ECF Doc. 1320-36, filed 01/03/24)

### Discovery Responses

Giuffre filed multiple amended responses to Maxwell's discovery requests:

- **First Response**: February 8, 2016
- **Amended Response**: March 22, 2016
- **Second Amended Response**: April 29, 2016 (ECF Doc. 1320-37, filed 01/03/24)

These responses raised numerous objections, including that requests:
- Violated Local Civil Rule 33.3 governing interrogatories
- Were overly broad and unduly burdensome
- Sought privileged attorney-client, work product, and public interest protected information
- Sought information equally available to Maxwell or within Maxwell's control

### Rule 26 Disclosures

- Revised Disclosure: March 11, 2016
- Addendum: March 22, 2016
