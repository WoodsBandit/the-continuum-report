## Executive Summary

Alan Morton Dershowitz is a prominent American lawyer, legal scholar, and emeritus professor at Harvard Law School. He became involved in the Jeffrey Epstein matter in multiple capacities: as Epstein's criminal defense attorney during the 2008 non-prosecution agreement negotiations, as a defendant in defamation litigation brought by Virginia Giuffre, and as a subject of sexual abuse allegations made by Giuffre in court filings.

This dossier examines Dershowitz's role based on court documents filed in various litigations, including *Giuffre v. Maxwell* (Case No. 15-cv-7433-LAP) and related cases. The documents reveal:

1. **Role as Epstein's Attorney**: Dershowitz served as part of Epstein's legal defense team during the 2006-2008 federal investigation and negotiation of the controversial non-prosecution agreement (NPA).

2. **Allegations by Virginia Giuffre**: Giuffre alleged in court filings that Dershowitz sexually abused her on multiple occasions when she was a minor, claims Dershowitz has vehemently and repeatedly denied.

3. **Defamation Litigation**: The allegations led to protracted defamation litigation between Dershowitz and Giuffre's attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, which was eventually settled.

4. **Public Statements**: Dershowitz has been publicly vocal in denying all allegations and challenging Giuffre's credibility through media appearances and court filings.

## I. Background and Professional Role

### A. Legal Career and Harvard Professorship

Alan Dershowitz is an emeritus professor of law at Harvard Law School, where he taught from 1964 to 2013. He is widely known for his work on criminal law, constitutional law, and civil liberties, and has represented numerous high-profile clients in criminal and appellate cases.

### B. Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein

According to court documents, Dershowitz was described as a "long-time friend" of Jeffrey Epstein who "frequented his homes at the time [Virginia] Roberts and other young girls were in Epstein's employ" (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24). This relationship predated Dershowitz's formal representation of Epstein as defense counsel.

A news article exhibit in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case states that "Dershowitz is an admitted long-time friend of Epstein's" and notes their social connections during the period when alleged trafficking was occurring (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24).

---

## II. Role as Epstein's Attorney

### A. Representation During 2008 NPA Negotiations

Dershowitz was part of the legal team that represented Jeffrey Epstein during the federal investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2006-2008. This team successfully negotiated a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with federal prosecutors that shielded Epstein and his alleged co-conspirators from federal prosecution.

Court documents reference Dershowitz's role as "a member of Epstein's defense team" during this critical period (ECF Doc. 1320-9, filed 01/03/24, Motion for Joinder).

The NPA has been widely criticized as unusually lenient, given the nature and scope of the allegations against Epstein. Under its terms:
- Epstein pleaded guilty only to state charges (solicitation of prostitution)
- He served 13 months in county jail with work-release privileges
- He and all potential co-conspirators received immunity from federal prosecution
- The agreement was kept secret from Epstein's alleged victims, violating their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA)

### B. Legal Strategy and Advocacy

Court documents indicate that Dershowitz played a significant role in crafting the legal and public relations strategy surrounding Epstein's defense. Discovery disclosures in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case sought "communications among counsel for Defendant and Epstein and Dershowitz" (ECF Doc. 1328-31, filed 01/05/24), suggesting coordination between defense teams.

Maxwell's attorneys identified Dershowitz as having "knowledge concerning press statements by Plaintiff and Defendant in 2011-2015 at issue in this matter" and "knowledge concerning matters at issue in the Complaint and in Plaintiff's pleadings and sworn statements in other litigations, including in particular her publicly filed allegations concerning Defendant and Alan Dershowitz" (ECF Doc. 1320-40, filed 01/03/24, Rule 26 Disclosures).

## III. Allegations by Virginia Giuffre

### A. The Allegations

In December 2014, Virginia Giuffre (then Virginia Roberts) made sworn allegations in a court filing that Alan Dershowitz had sexually abused her when she was a minor. These allegations appeared in a Motion for Joinder filed on behalf of Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 in *Doe v. United States*, Case No. 08-80736-KAM (ECF Doc. 1320-9, filed 12/30/14).

According to the motion, the allegations included:

1. **Identity of Accuser**: The motion identified "Jane Doe #3" as Virginia Roberts (Giuffre), who alleged she was "forced to have sexual relations with" several men, including "another prince," "the owner of a large hotel chain in France," and "a well-known Prime Minister." The filing also specifically named Alan Dershowitz.

2. **Locations**: The allegations stated that Epstein "required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

3. **Purpose and Context**: The motion alleged that Epstein used Giuffre for the purpose of "ingratiat[ing] himself" with Dershowitz, who was described as being part of Epstein's legal defense team. The filing suggested this was part of a pattern where Epstein used sexual exploitation of minors to develop relationships with "politically connected and financially powerful people."

4. **Specific Claims**: According to media exhibits in the case file, Giuffre alleged that she "had sex with [Dershowitz] six times beginning when she was 16 at Epstein's residences, as well as on his jet and private island" (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24).

5. **Witness to Other Acts**: The same media exhibit quotes allegations that Dershowitz "was so comfortable with the sex that was going on that he would even come and chat with Epstein while I was giving oral sex to Epstein" (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24).

### B. Dershowitz's Denial

Dershowitz immediately and categorically denied all allegations. His responses included:

1. **Categorical Denial**: Dershowitz stated he never had any sexual contact with Giuffre or any other minor. According to court exhibits, he characterized himself as the victim of false allegations.

2. **Attack on Credibility**: Court documents show that Dershowitz and his representatives publicly characterized Giuffre in highly negative terms. A media article exhibit is titled "Document: 'Sex slave' accuser is serial liar, prostitute" (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24), reflecting Dershowitz's public characterization of Giuffre's credibility.

3. **Documentary Evidence**: Dershowitz claimed to possess evidence (travel records, phone records, etc.) proving he was not at the locations Giuffre specified at the times she claimed. However, the specifics of this evidence do not appear in the reviewed documents.

4. **Demand for Deposition**: According to media reports included as exhibits, "Giuffre's attorneys have claimed that Dershowitz has refused to submit to deposition," though Dershowitz publicly stated he wanted to be deposed to refute the allegations under oath (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24).

---

## IV. Defamation Litigation

### A. Dershowitz's Defamation Suit Against Giuffre's Attorneys

The allegations triggered defamation litigation. Dershowitz sued Virginia Giuffre's attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, in Florida state court (*Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz*, Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County), alleging they defamed him by including the allegations about him in their court filings.

Court documents reference "Deposition testimony of Paul G. Cassell, dated October 16, 2015 and October 17, 2015" in the defamation case (ECF Doc. 1320-40, filed 01/03/24), indicating substantive litigation occurred.

### B. Resolution and Joint Statement

According to court documents, the parties eventually reached a settlement. Maxwell's Rule 26 disclosures reference a "Joint Statement of Brad Edwards, Paul Cassell and Alan Dershowitz (Apr. 8, 2016)" resolving "All Proceedings Against Professor Dershowitz" (ECF Doc. 1320-40, filed 01/03/24).

The specific terms of the settlement have not been made public in the documents reviewed. However, the settlement appears to have resolved the defamation claims between Dershowitz and Giuffre's attorneys.

## V. Appearance in Giuffre v. Maxwell

### A. References in Discovery

Dershowitz's name appears extensively in documents filed in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* (Case No. 15-cv-7433-LAP), the defamation case Virginia Giuffre brought against Ghislaine Maxwell. These references include:

1. **Witness Lists**: Maxwell's attorneys identified "David Boies" as having "knowledge concerning matters at issue in the Complaint and in Plaintiff's pleadings and sworn statements in other litigations, including in particular her publicly filed allegations concerning Defendant and Alan Dershowitz" (ECF Doc. 1320-40, filed 01/03/24).

2. **Document Requests**: Multiple discovery requests sought documents related to Dershowitz. Maxwell's disclosures indicate intent to use documents from "Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz" and "Jane Doe #1 and #2 v. United States" cases (ECF Doc. 1320-40, filed 01/03/24).

3. **Deposition References**: Various depositions contain discussions of Dershowitz. Documents show requests for information about "Dershowitz, Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Glenn and Eva Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcincova and Bill and Hillary Clinton" among others (ECF Doc. 1327-12, filed 01/05/24).

### B. Dershowitz as Intervenor

In January 2024, Dershowitz filed as an intervenor seeking to unseal certain documents in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case. In an order dated January 5, 2024 (ECF Doc. 1329-0_1), Judge Loretta A. Preska denied letter-motions to unseal docket entry 1026-3 (a list of Jane and John Does), citing privacy interests and noting that "the underlying documents have already been ordered unsealed with respect to most of the Does."

The court's order noted concerns about the "recent media frenzy about some supposed 'Epstein List' and the mass speculation about the identities of those on it," stating that unsealing the master list could "lead to speculation about the identities of the as-yet-unnamed Does" (ECF Doc. 1329-0_1, filed 01/05/24).

---

## VI. Public Statements and Media Strategy

### A. Media Appearances

Court filings and exhibits indicate that Dershowitz engaged in an aggressive public relations campaign to defend himself against Giuffre's allegations. This included:

1. **Television Appearances**: Multiple media interviews denying the allegations
2. **Written Statements**: Op-eds and public statements challenging Giuffre's credibility
3. **Social Media**: Public commentary on platforms like Twitter

Maxwell's attorneys noted that Dershowitz had "knowledge concerning press statements by Plaintiff and Defendant in 2011-2015 at issue in this matter" (ECF Doc. 1320-40, filed 01/03/24), indicating his involvement in the public discourse surrounding the case.

### B. Characterization of Giuffre

Documents show Dershowitz and his representatives publicly characterized Virginia Giuffre using highly negative terms. A news article included as an exhibit bears the headline "Document: 'Sex slave' accuser is serial liar, prostitute" (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24).

The article states: "The woman is Virginia Roberts, one of as many as 40 women who allege that Epstein recruited them while they were minors into a sex ring based at Epstein's Palm Beach mansion" (ECF Doc. 1328-19, filed 01/05/24).

These characterizations became part of the defamation disputes between the parties.

## VII. Legal and Ethical Questions

The Dershowitz matter raises several legal and ethical questions that have been subjects of public debate:

### A. Attorney Conduct During NPA Negotiations

Questions have been raised about the propriety of the tactics used by Epstein's legal team, including Dershowitz, during the 2008 NPA negotiations. Critics have argued that:
- The agreement was unusually favorable to Epstein
- Victims' rights were violated when they were not notified of the NPA
- Defense attorneys may have used aggressive tactics to intimidate victims
- The secrecy of the agreement prevented victims from objecting to its terms

### B. Conflict of Interest

If the allegations against Dershowitz are true, his role as Epstein's attorney while simultaneously being involved in the conduct at issue would present serious conflict of interest and ethical violations. Dershowitz has maintained that the allegations are entirely false, rendering any potential conflict moot in his view.

### C. Victim Credibility vs. Presumption of Innocence

The matter highlights the tension between believing sexual abuse victims and respecting the presumption of innocence. Dershowitz has argued that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and that Giuffre's allegations should be thoroughly scrutinized. Conversely, victims' advocates argue that the aggressive attacks on Giuffre's credibility exemplify how sexual abuse victims are often discouraged from coming forward.

---

## VIII. Current Status

As of the document review date:

1. **No Criminal Charges**: No criminal charges have been filed against Dershowitz related to the allegations made by Virginia Giuffre.

2. **Settled Civil Litigation**: The defamation litigation between Dershowitz and Giuffre's attorneys has been settled pursuant to the April 2016 joint statement.

3. **Continued Public Debate**: Dershowitz continues to publicly deny the allegations and defend his reputation through media appearances and public statements.

4. **Document Unsealing**: Many documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case containing references to Dershowitz have been unsealed pursuant to court orders in 2023-2024, contributing to renewed public attention to the allegations.

---

## IX. Analysis and Commentary

The Dershowitz matter illustrates several significant issues in contemporary legal practice and public discourse:

### A. The Power of Representation

Dershowitz's involvement demonstrates how skilled legal representation can achieve favorable outcomes even in cases involving serious allegations. The 2008 NPA is widely regarded as extraordinarily beneficial to Epstein and his associates, raising questions about the balance of power between well-resourced defendants and less-resourced victims in the criminal justice system.

### B. The Challenge of Historical Allegations

The allegations against Dershowitz are difficult to prove or disprove, involving events alleged to have occurred decades ago with limited physical evidence beyond testimonial accounts. This reality characterizes many sexual abuse allegations and creates evidentiary challenges for all parties. The lack of contemporaneous reporting, witnesses, or physical evidence makes definitive resolution of the factual disputes nearly impossible.

### C. The Court of Public Opinion

The matter has largely played out in public, with both sides using media and public statements to advance their positions. This dynamic raises questions about how allegations should be handled when criminal prosecution is not pursued. The aggressive public relations campaigns on both sides have turned what might have been a private legal matter into a highly publicized dispute with reputational consequences regardless of the legal outcome.

### D. Implications for Victims' Rights

The Epstein matter generally, and Dershowitz's role specifically, has contributed to increased scrutiny of how sex trafficking victims are treated by the criminal justice system and whether their rights are adequately protected during plea negotiations. The secretive nature of the 2008 NPA, which denied victims the opportunity to object or even be heard, has been cited as a prime example of systemic failures in protecting victims' rights.

### E. Defamation Law and Public Figure Litigation

The defamation litigation between Dershowitz and Giuffre's attorneys raises important questions about the boundaries of advocacy and the extent to which attorneys can be held liable for including allegations in court filings. The settlement of that litigation leaves these questions largely unresolved as a matter of law.

---

## X. Conclusion

Alan Dershowitz occupies a unique and controversial position in the Jeffrey Epstein matter. As Epstein's attorney, he was instrumental in securing the 2008 non-prosecution agreement that has been widely condemned as a miscarriage of justice. As a subject of allegations by Virginia Giuffre, he became embroiled in litigation and public controversy that continues to affect his reputation. Throughout, he has maintained his innocence and challenged the credibility of his accusers with considerable vigor.

The documentary record reveals a complex legal and factual landscape where serious allegations meet vigorous denials, where the rights of victims intersect with the presumption of innocence, and where the practice of law raises profound ethical questions. No criminal charges have been filed against Dershowitz, and the civil litigation has been settled, leaving many factual questions unresolved.

The unsealing of court documents in 2023-2024 has brought renewed attention to Dershowitz's alleged involvement in the Epstein matter, but has not produced definitive evidence either proving or disproving Giuffre's allegations. The matter remains a subject of public debate and serves as a case study in the challenges of addressing historical allegations of sexual abuse involving powerful individuals.

As with all matters documented in this report, readers should recognize that allegations in court filings are not established facts, that Dershowitz has consistently and categorically denied any wrongdoing, and that the legal system has not made any definitive findings regarding the truth of the allegations against him. The inclusion of information in this dossier does not constitute an accusation or imply guilt.
