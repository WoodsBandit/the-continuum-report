## Executive Summary

The Terramar Project was an ocean conservation nonprofit organization founded by Ghislaine Maxwell. According to court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell defamation case, the organization appears in email communications with Maxwell's signature line during the period when allegations against her and Jeffrey Epstein first became public in January 2015. The organization is referenced in discovery disputes regarding Maxwell's financial affairs and email accounts. The Terramar Project shut down in 2019, shortly after Jeffrey Epstein's arrest in July of that year.

## Organizational Overview

### Stated Mission

The Terramar Project presented itself as an ocean conservation and advocacy organization. According to email communications in the court record, the organization had:

- Social media presence (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram)
- A pledge program
- "The Daily Catch" - appears to be a newsletter or blog feature
- Email domain: @theterramarproject.org

In an email dated January 25, 2015, Jeffrey Epstein wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell stating: "i had lisa svenson the swedish ocean ambassador yesteday she said no one on her ocean panel takes this stuff seriously and you would be welcoe to the ocean conferenec water conference etc." (ECF Doc. 1330-5, filed 01/05/24, p. 2). This suggests Maxwell had involvement with ocean-related conferences and panels through the organization.

### Founding and Operations

The exact founding date of The Terramar Project is not specified in the available court documents. However, the organization was operational by at least January 2015, as evidenced by email communications where Maxwell used the Terramar Project email signature and Jeffrey Epstein referenced her involvement with ocean advocacy work.

According to discovery requests in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case, plaintiff's counsel specifically sought access to "any of Ms. Maxwell's email account associated with The Terramar Project (including any account ending in @theterramarproject.org)" (ECF Doc. 1327-2, filed 01/05/24, p. 2).

### Closure After Epstein's Arrest

While the exact closure date is not detailed in these specific court documents, public reporting indicates The Terramar Project shut down in 2019 following Jeffrey Epstein's arrest in July of that year. The timing suggests a connection between the organization's viability and the intensifying scrutiny on both Epstein and Maxwell.

## Connection to the Epstein Network

### Maxwell's Use of Terramar in Crisis Communications

The court documents reveal that Maxwell used The Terramar Project branding extensively in her email communications during the crisis period in January 2015, when Virginia Giuffre's allegations against Maxwell and Epstein first became public. Nearly every email from Maxwell during this period contains The Terramar Project signature line with links to the organization's social media platforms.

In an email dated January 10, 2015, sent from gmaxl@ellmax.com to Philip Barden and Ross Gow, Maxwell discussed her legal concerns about responding to allegations. The email signature included full Terramar Project branding (ECF Doc. 1330-21, filed 01/05/24, p. 2; also ECF Doc. 1320-1, filed 01/03/24, p. 2).

### Epstein's Encouragement During Crisis

On January 25, 2015, Jeffrey Epstein sent Maxwell an email stating: "ok, with me, You have done nothing wrong and i woudl urge you to start acting like it. go outside, head high, not as an esacping convict. go to parties. deal with it. . i had lisa svenson the swedish ocean ambassador yesteday she said no one on her ocean panel takes this stuff seriously and you would be welcoe to the ocean conferenec water conference etc." (ECF Doc. 1330-5, filed 01/05/24, p. 2).

This communication suggests Epstein was actively encouraging Maxwell to continue her public-facing ocean conservation work through Terramar despite the emerging allegations, positioning it as a means of maintaining normalcy and reputation.

### Financial Discovery Disputes

The Terramar Project became a subject of discovery disputes in the defamation case. According to plaintiff's opposition to defendant's motion for protective order regarding financial information, filed August 22, 2016:

"Defendant should also be required to identify all financial transactions involving (directly or indirectly) Jeffrey Epstein, the Clinton Foundation, Ellmax LLC, The TerraMar Project, and any other person listed in the Rule 26 disclosures of either side in this case." (ECF Doc. 1328-23, filed 01/05/24, p. 19-20).

The plaintiff's counsel argued these transactions were relevant to understanding potential bias of witnesses and assessing punitive damages.

In a declaration filed August 22, 2016, plaintiff's counsel stated: "Attached hereto as Sealed Composite Exhibit 9 are true copies of Ellmax, LLC and The TerraMar Project Subpoenas." (ECF Doc. 1328-24, filed 01/05/24, p. 2).

This indicates that subpoenas were issued to The Terramar Project as part of the discovery process, though the contents of those subpoenas and any responses are sealed.

### Institutional Connections

The plaintiff's financial discovery requests specifically grouped The Terramar Project alongside other entities with known connections to Epstein and Maxwell:

- Jeffrey Epstein (directly)
- The Clinton Foundation
- Ellmax LLC (Maxwell's business entity)

This grouping in litigation strategy suggests counsel viewed The Terramar Project as part of the broader financial and organizational network surrounding Maxwell and Epstein.

## Email Infrastructure

According to discovery correspondence dated June 30, 2016, plaintiff's counsel specifically requested:

"please use IMAP Capable software (or a functional equivalent) to capture all of the sent/received emails from Ms. Maxwell's various email accounts, including but not limited to the following: (1) GMaxl@ellmax.com (and any other accounts at ellmax.com); (2) gmaxl@mindspring.com (and any other accounts at mindspring.com); (3) any of Ms. Maxwell's email account associated with The Terramar Project (including any account ending in @theterramarproject.org); and (4) any other email accounts either used in the past, or currently in use." (ECF Doc. 1327-2, filed 01/05/24, p. 2).

The Terramar Project email accounts were thus treated as potentially containing relevant evidence in the defamation case, placed on equal footing with Maxwell's personal and business accounts.

An email from Maxwell dated April 22, 2015, sent from "Ghislaine@theterramarproject.org," addressed allegations that "Epstein and Maxwell asked her to have a child for them." Maxwell responded to this allegation through her Terramar Project email account, stating: "At no point in Ms Maxwell's life has she ever contemplated thought or wanted to bring up someone's child as her own and or ask the mother to sign her rights away to the child." (ECF Doc. 1330-9, filed 01/05/24, p. 5).

This demonstrates Maxwell's use of The Terramar Project email infrastructure for communications related to the Epstein allegations and litigation strategy.

## Analysis

### Organizational Legitimacy Questions

The documentary evidence raises questions about the relationship between The Terramar Project's stated ocean conservation mission and its functional role in Maxwell's life during the period of intensifying scrutiny. Several patterns emerge:

1. **Timing of Communications**: Maxwell's extensive use of Terramar branding intensified during the crisis period of January 2015, when allegations first became public.

2. **Epstein's Role**: Jeffrey Epstein actively encouraged Maxwell to continue Terramar-related activities as a means of maintaining public normalcy, suggesting he viewed the organization at least partly through a reputational lens.

3. **Discovery Treatment**: Plaintiff's counsel grouped The Terramar Project with Ellmax LLC and the Clinton Foundation in financial discovery requests, suggesting they viewed it as part of Maxwell's broader organizational network rather than a standalone charitable entity.

4. **Closure Timing**: The organization's shutdown following Epstein's 2019 arrest suggests its viability was connected to the status of the Epstein-Maxwell relationship and public scrutiny thereof.

### Unanswered Questions

The sealed nature of the Terramar Project subpoenas and related financial documents leaves significant gaps in the public record:

- What was the full scope of The Terramar Project's funding sources?
- What financial transactions occurred between The Terramar Project and Jeffrey Epstein or Epstein-controlled entities?
- What were the organization's actual programmatic activities beyond social media presence?
- Who else was involved in the organization's governance or operations?
- What prompted the decision to shut down in 2019, and who made that decision?

The available documents establish The Terramar Project as an active part of Maxwell's professional identity during the period when allegations emerged, but do not provide sufficient detail to assess the organization's substantive work or its full relationship to the Epstein network.
