## Statement of Public Interest

Jeffrey Epstein owned and operated multiple private aircraft, including at least two Gulfstream jets in addition to his Boeing 727 (the "Lolita Express"). These aircraft were used for travel between Epstein's properties and international destinations. Flight logs from these aircraft were entered as evidence in civil litigation and have been the subject of federal records requests. The aircraft registration to corporations in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which shared addresses with Epstein's offices, has been a matter of public record through FAA filings. Customs and Border Protection records regarding aircraft arrivals have been released pursuant to FOIA requests. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse regarding matters of significant public concern.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** In addition to the Boeing 727 known as the "Lolita Express," Jeffrey Epstein owned and operated Gulfstream aircraft for private travel. Based on our review of publicly available records and court filings, Epstein's aviation assets included a Gulfstream IV (tail number N212JE) registered to JEGE, LLC and a Gulfstream GV-SP (tail number N120JE) registered to Plan D, LLC. Both corporations were established in the U.S. Virgin Islands and shared an address with Epstein's office in St. Thomas.

The Gulfstream aircraft were operated by pilots David Rodgers and Larry Visoski, the same pilots who operated the Boeing 727. Flight logs from these aircraft documented travel between Epstein's properties including Palm Beach, Manhattan, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New Mexico. Court filings in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* reference Epstein's "aircraft" (plural), and flight logs entered as exhibits encompass travel on multiple aircraft types.

In our assessment, the Gulfstream jets served as part of a fleet that facilitated movement between Epstein's various properties and international destinations, operating in parallel with the larger Boeing 727.

## The Public Record

*This section presents factual information from court documents, public records, and official sources without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Aircraft Registration

**Federal Aviation Administration Records:**

According to publicly available FAA registration data:
- **N212JE**: Gulfstream IV registered to JEGE, LLC (U.S. Virgin Islands)
- **N120JE**: Gulfstream GV-SP registered to Plan D, LLC (U.S. Virgin Islands)

Both corporate entities share an address with Epstein's office in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

### Customs and Border Protection Records

**CBP Report of Aircraft Arrival:**

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has released records regarding aircraft arrivals under Epstein's control pursuant to FOIA requests. These records document international arrivals and associated passenger information.

### Flight Logs in Court Filings

**[ECF Doc. 1330-3](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1330-3.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Plaintiff's Fourth Revised Disclosure Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26):

The Rule 26 disclosures list flight logs as evidence:

> "6. Flight Logs, attached hereto as Composite Exhibit 6."

The disclosure identifies pilots David Rodgers and Larry Visoski as witnesses with knowledge of travel on Epstein's aircraft.

### References to Multiple Aircraft

**[ECF Doc. 1331-32](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-32.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Court documents reference Epstein's aircraft (plural), establishing that multiple aircraft were part of his aviation fleet. Flight logs document travel to:
- Palm Beach, Florida
- New York City (Teterboro)
- Little St. James Island, U.S. Virgin Islands
- New Mexico (Zorro Ranch)
- Paris, France
- London, England

**[ECF Doc. 1320-6](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-6.pdf), filed 01/03/24** (Plaintiff's Unredacted Reply):

> "Moreover, again according to flight logs, Defendant was on Epstein's planes over 300 times - including 23 times with Ms. Giuffre when Ms. Giuffre was underage."

The reference to "planes" (plural) indicates flight log evidence encompassed multiple aircraft.

### Pilot Operations

**[ECF Doc. 1328-14](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-14.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Deposition of David Rodgers):

David Rodgers was deposed on June 3, 2016, regarding his role as Epstein's pilot. Rodgers operated multiple aircraft in Epstein's fleet and maintained flight logs for all aircraft he piloted.

**[ECF Doc. 1330-3](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1330-3.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Larry Visoski is identified as a witness with knowledge "of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein's sexual trafficking conduct and interaction with underage minors" in his capacity as pilot.

### Sarah Ransome Affidavit

**[ECF Doc. 1331-32](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-32.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Affidavit of Sarah Ransome):

> "After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction. I am told that my name appears on the flight logs of one or more of those trips."

The reference to "one of Jeffrey's private airplanes" confirms the existence of multiple aircraft in the fleet.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the Gulfstream's role in Epstein's operations:** In our assessment, the Gulfstream aircraft (models IV and GV-SP) served as smaller, more flexible transportation options compared to the larger Boeing 727. Gulfstream jets typically accommodate fewer passengers but offer greater range and access to smaller airports. This suggests, in our view, that the Gulfstream aircraft may have been used for trips requiring more discretion or destinations with shorter runways.

**Regarding corporate registration:** The registration of both aircraft to Virgin Islands corporations sharing Epstein's office address appears to reflect a deliberate structuring of asset ownership. We interpret this as consistent with the broader pattern of Epstein utilizing Virgin Islands entities for business and property holdings.

**Regarding flight log integration:** Court filings reference "flight logs" without always distinguishing between aircraft types. In our assessment, the statistical claims made in litigation (e.g., "over 300 flights," "23 flights with Giuffre") likely encompass travel on all aircraft in Epstein's fleet, including the Gulfstream jets.

**Regarding the pilots:** Both David Rodgers and Larry Visoski are identified as pilots with knowledge of travel patterns. Given that both operated multiple aircraft types, the flight log evidence maintained by these pilots would document travel across Epstein's entire aviation fleet.

**Regarding evidentiary significance:** The Gulfstream aircraft, while receiving less media attention than the Boeing 727 "Lolita Express," constitute important transportation infrastructure in understanding Epstein's operations. International arrivals documented in CBP records and domestic flights recorded in pilot logs provide objective evidence of travel patterns.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Gulfstream aircraft represent a significant but underreported element of Epstein's aviation operations. The documentary record establishes that Epstein maintained multiple aircraft, that these aircraft were operated by the same pilots, and that flight logs document travel across the entire fleet. The Virgin Islands corporate registration of these assets appears consistent with Epstein's broader use of that jurisdiction for business structuring.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Private jet ownership is common among the wealthy.** Ultra-high-net-worth individuals frequently own multiple aircraft for different purposes (long-haul vs. short trips, larger groups vs. small parties). The existence of multiple aircraft is not, by itself, indicative of wrongdoing.

2. **Corporate aircraft registration is standard practice.** Registering aircraft through corporate entities for liability protection and tax considerations is routine in private aviation. Virgin Islands incorporation may reflect legitimate business structuring rather than concealment.

3. **Flight logs document travel, not purpose.** Presence on any of Epstein's aircraft establishes only that an individual traveled on a particular flight. It does not establish the purpose of travel, knowledge of activities at destinations, or participation in alleged crimes.

4. **The Gulfstream may have been used primarily for legitimate travel.** Epstein maintained extensive business interests requiring travel. Many Gulfstream flights may have involved routine business, social, or philanthropic activities with no connection to alleged criminal conduct.

5. **Pilot testimony provides limited insight.** Pilots observe who boards aircraft and where flights go. They typically do not have knowledge of activities occurring at destinations or the nature of relationships between passengers.

6. **Privacy measures were industry-standard.** Epstein's use of programs to conceal real-time aircraft movements is available to all private jet owners. This privacy feature does not inherently indicate criminal purpose.

7. **The focus on aircraft may be misdirected.** Transportation between properties is a prerequisite for alleged crimes but is itself lawful. The aircraft were tools that, like automobiles or boats, facilitated movement without constituting instruments of crime.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of court filings that reference Jeffrey Epstein's aircraft, supplemented by publicly available FAA registration data, CBP records, and flight tracking information.

**What we did review:**
- Court filings from *Giuffre v. Maxwell* referencing aircraft and flight logs
- Publicly available FAA aircraft registration data
- CBP aircraft arrival reports released under FOIA
- Public flight tracking data compiled by independent researchers
- Existing analytical briefs on related entities (Boeing 727, Flight Logs, pilots)

**What we did not review:**
- Complete, unredacted flight logs for Gulfstream aircraft
- Full deposition transcripts of pilots regarding Gulfstream operations
- Complete aircraft purchase and sale records
- Maintenance and operational records
- Corporate formation documents for JEGE, LLC and Plan D, LLC

**Critical limitations:**
- Court filings typically reference "aircraft" or "planes" without specifying aircraft type
- Statistics cited in litigation (e.g., "over 300 flights") likely aggregate travel across all aircraft
- The complete Gulfstream-specific flight logs are not available in the public record
- This analysis relies on secondary sources for registration and tail number information

**Note on aircraft identification:** Public records identify multiple Gulfstream aircraft associated with Epstein. The specific flights documented in court filings may have occurred on either the Boeing 727 or Gulfstream jets, and existing records do not always distinguish between aircraft types.
