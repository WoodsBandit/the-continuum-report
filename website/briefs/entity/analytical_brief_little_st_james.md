## Statement of Public Interest

Little St. James Island, Jeffrey Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, is referenced extensively in court documents as a location where alleged abuse occurred. Multiple victim affidavits and depositions describe the island as a site where young women and girls were brought and where sexual abuse allegedly took place over many years. The property's remote location, private ownership, and use in the alleged trafficking operation make it central to understanding the geographic scope of Epstein's activities. These documents were unsealed by federal court order in January 2024, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Little St. James Island, located in the U.S. Virgin Islands near St. Thomas, was Jeffrey Epstein's private property from 1998 until his death in 2019. Based on our review of court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation, the island appears in multiple victim accounts as a location where alleged abuse occurred. Sarah Ransome's sworn affidavit describes being transported to the island multiple times and observing Ghislaine Maxwell supervising young women there. Virginia Giuffre's accounts, quoted in court filings, describe dinners and events on the island involving prominent individuals. In our assessment, the documentary record suggests the island served as a key location in what prosecutors and courts have characterized as a sex trafficking operation, with its isolation providing apparent privacy for illegal activities.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Property Overview

Little St. James Island is a 70-acre private island located approximately one mile southeast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Court documents reference it as one of Epstein's primary residences alongside properties in Palm Beach (Florida), Manhattan (New York), New Mexico (Zorro Ranch), and Paris (France).

### Sarah Ransome Affidavit

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Sarah Ransome provided a sworn affidavit dated January 5, 2017, describing her experiences on the island:

> "In the summer of 2006, when I was twenty-two years old and living in New York, I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein by a girl I had met named Natalya Malyshov. Shortly after meeting Jeffrey he invited me to fly to his private island in the US Virgin Islands, which I did. After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction... As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, Nadia Macinkova, and various other girls and guests he brought to the island."

Regarding observations of minors and Ghislaine Maxwell's role on the island:

> "During one of my visits to the island I met Ghislaine Maxwell. Watching her interact with the other girls on the island, it became clear to me that she recruited all or many of them to the island. Once they were there, she appeared to be in charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with, and how they were supposed to stay in line. She assumed the same supervisory role with me as soon as I arrived. Some of the girls appeared to be 18 or older, but many appeared to be young teenagers. I recall seeing a particularly young, thin girl who looked well under 18 and recall asking her her age."

### Virginia Giuffre's Accounts

**[ECF Doc. 1320-28](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-28.pdf), filed 01/03/24, pp. 7-8** (Maxwell's Opposition to Extending Deposition Deadline, quoting media report):

> "On one occasion, she adds, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to dinner which he gave on his Caribbean island for Mr. Clinton shortly after he left office. But as far as she knows, the ex-President did not take the bait. 'I'd have been about 17 at the time,' she says. 'I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey bought her...'"

**[ECF Doc. 1320-28](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-28.pdf), filed 01/03/24, p. 8** (quoting Giuffre's unpublished manuscript *The Billionaire Playboys' Club*):

> "The next big dinner party on the island had another significant guest appearance being the one and only, Bill Clinton... This wasn't a big party as such, only a few of us eating at the diner table. There was Jeffrey at the head of it all, as always. On the left side was Emmy, Ghislaine and I sitting across the table from us was Bill with two lovely girls who were visiting from New York..."

### Rebuttal Regarding Clinton Visit

**[ECF Doc. 1320-28](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-28.pdf), filed 01/03/24, p. 8:**

> "Former FBI Director Louis Freeh submitted a report wherein he concluded that President Clinton 'did not, in fact travel to, nor was he present on, Little St. James Island between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2003.' Further, if any Secret Service agents had accompanied Clinton to that location, 'they would have been required to make and file shift logs, travel vouchers, and related documentation relating to the visit,' and there was a 'total absence' of any such documentation."

### Flight Log References

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24, p. 2:**

> "On December 14, 2006 (Flight #1920), Sarah Ransome flew from TIST (USVI) to EWR (Newark, NJ) with Jeffrey Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova. See Giuffre 07139."

Flight logs entered as exhibits document extensive travel between Epstein's properties, including flights to and from the U.S. Virgin Islands on private aircraft.

### Allegations Regarding Other Locations

**[ECF Doc. 1320-9](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-9.pdf), filed 01/03/24** (Motion for Joinder):

Court filings alleged that Epstein required victims to travel between multiple properties, including "the U.S. Virgin Islands" alongside Florida, New York, New Mexico, and international locations.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the island's role:** In our assessment, Little St. James Island appears to have served as a central location in what prosecutors and courts characterized as a sex trafficking operation. Its remote location, private ownership, and geographic isolation appear to have provided a setting where activities could occur away from public scrutiny and law enforcement oversight.

**Regarding victim accounts:** Multiple sworn statements describe the island as a destination where young women and girls were transported. Sarah Ransome's affidavit, provided under oath, describes her own experiences there as an adult (age 22) and her observations of individuals who "appeared to be young teenagers." The consistency of accounts from different individuals describing the island as a location of alleged abuse lends weight to these characterizations.

**Regarding Maxwell's role on the island:** Ransome's description of Maxwell as someone who "appeared to be in charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with, and how they were supposed to stay in line" aligns with the supervisory role for which Maxwell was ultimately convicted. The island appears, based on this account, to have been a location where Maxwell exercised her alleged recruiting and supervisory functions.

**Regarding prominent visitors:** Court filings contain allegations about various prominent individuals visiting the island. We note that allegations in civil filings have different evidentiary standards than criminal convictions. The Freeh Report regarding Bill Clinton demonstrates that some allegations about the island have been specifically disputed with investigative findings.

**Regarding documentary limitations:** The documentary record we reviewed consists of civil litigation materials. While these include sworn affidavits and depositions, they represent adversarial proceedings where allegations have not always been tested or adjudicated.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record establishes Little St. James Island as a significant location in the Epstein trafficking operation. Multiple victim accounts describe it as a destination for abuse. The isolation of a private island appears to have facilitated activities that were criminal in nature. The property represents a tangible example of how wealth and resources were deployed to create spaces where exploitation could occur with apparent impunity.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing the documentary record might consider:

1. **Geographic isolation cuts both ways.** While a private island may facilitate secrecy, it also means that activities there are particularly difficult to independently verify. Victim accounts are the primary source of information about what occurred there.

2. **Adult versus minor victims.** Sarah Ransome, whose affidavit provides detailed descriptions of the island, was 22 years old during her visits—an adult. Her observations about others who "appeared to be young teenagers" are observations, not documentation of specific ages or crimes.

3. **Civil litigation context.** The accounts we cite come from civil litigation materials. While sworn statements carry legal weight, they are advocacy documents prepared in the context of litigation against specific defendants.

4. **Disputed allegations about visitors.** Some allegations about prominent individuals visiting the island have been specifically disputed with investigative findings (e.g., the Freeh Report regarding Clinton). This demonstrates that allegations in civil filings should not be treated as established facts.

5. **Limited physical evidence in court record.** The civil litigation record does not include extensive physical evidence from the island itself. FBI searches following Epstein's 2019 arrest may have produced additional evidence not reflected in these civil documents.

6. **Property versus conduct.** The island itself is a property—buildings and land. The significance of the location derives from allegations about what occurred there, not inherent characteristics of the property.

7. **Estate disposition.** The island was sold by Epstein's estate in 2023. Questions about how the property should be used or memorialized involve complex considerations beyond the scope of this documentary analysis.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of civil litigation documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case that reference Little St. James Island.

**What we did not review:**
- Physical evidence collected during FBI searches of the island (2019)
- Complete flight logs documenting travel to/from the island
- USVI government records or investigations
- Building permits, construction records, or property documentation
- Testimony or evidence from the Maxwell criminal trial specific to the island
- Media reporting and investigative journalism about the property
- Drone footage or satellite imagery widely circulated in media

**Note:** This brief focuses on references to the island in civil litigation documents. The property itself was the subject of USVI government civil litigation against Epstein's estate, which produced additional documentation not reviewed here.
