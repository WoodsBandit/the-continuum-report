## Statement of Public Interest

Leslie Wexner is the founder of L Brands (formerly The Limited), which owned Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, and other retail brands. His documented financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, including the granting of power of attorney, has been the subject of civil litigation discovery, journalistic investigation, and public interest.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Leslie Wexner represents the most significant documented financial relationship in Jeffrey Epstein's network. Court documents and published accounts establish that Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs and that Epstein managed significant Wexner assets. The relationship, which began in the mid-1980s, ended in 2007 according to Wexner's public statements. Wexner has stated he was deceived by Epstein and was unaware of criminal activity. He was never charged with any crime and was not named as a defendant in civil litigation against Epstein or Maxwell. Court deposition testimony includes questions about Wexner but does not establish his knowledge of or involvement in any criminal conduct.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the financial relationship:** The documented financial relationship between Wexner and Epstein was extraordinary in scope. Granting power of attorney to a financial manager is unusual, particularly for a billionaire with access to institutional wealth management. The nature and extent of this arrangement raises questions, but we note that unusual business relationships do not establish knowledge of criminal activity.

**Regarding Maxwell's denial:** Maxwell's "categorical" denial of providing clothing for Wexner is part of the evidentiary record. The question itself suggests the plaintiff's attorneys believed such conduct was possible, but a question is not an allegation, and Maxwell's denial is also part of the record.

**Regarding Wexner's statements:** Wexner has publicly stated he was deceived by Epstein. We note that this statement was made after Epstein's death when it could not be contradicted by Epstein. However, the absence of criminal charges or civil claims against Wexner is consistent with his account.

**Regarding the absence of charges:** Federal prosecutors investigating Epstein did not charge Wexner or name him as a co-conspirator. Civil litigants, including alleged victims, did not name Wexner as a defendant. This suggests that available evidence did not support claims of criminal involvement.

**Our editorial judgment:** Leslie Wexner represents a significant figure in understanding Epstein's financial network. However, the documented record establishes a financial relationship, not criminal complicity. Wexner's account of being deceived has not been contradicted by court proceedings or criminal charges.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Successful deception:** Wexner may have been genuinely deceived by Epstein. Sophisticated fraud perpetrators often target wealthy individuals and maintain respectable facades.

- **Due diligence failure:** Wexner may have failed to exercise appropriate due diligence over his financial affairs without having knowledge of criminal activity.

- **Business relationship only:** The Wexner-Epstein relationship may have been purely financial, with Wexner having no knowledge of or involvement in Epstein's personal life.

- **Absence of evidence:** The lack of criminal charges and civil claims against Wexner may reflect insufficient evidence rather than definitive innocence.

- **Questions remain unanswered:** The full scope of the financial relationship between Wexner and Epstein has not been publicly disclosed. Questions about asset transfers and the mansion ownership remain.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
