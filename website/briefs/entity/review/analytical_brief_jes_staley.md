## Statement of Public Interest

James Staley was the Chief Executive Officer of Barclays, one of the world's largest financial institutions, from December 2015 to November 2021. His relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and his subsequent mischaracterization of that relationship to regulators, resulted in the highest-profile individual enforcement action under the UK's Senior Managers Regime. The Financial Conduct Authority published its Decision Notice and Final Notice, and the Upper Tribunal published its judgment, making these regulatory findings matters of public record. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse regarding accountability standards for senior financial executives.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** James "Jes" Staley served as Head of JPMorgan's Private Bank and later CEO of Barclays. Based on our review of regulatory findings, he exchanged approximately 1,700 emails with Jeffrey Epstein between 2008 and 2015, visited Epstein's private island and other properties multiple times, and described Epstein in writing as one of his "deepest" and "most cherished" friends. In our assessment, the documentary record suggests a relationship that extended far beyond the "professional, fairly close" characterization Staley provided to Barclays and the FCA. The Upper Tribunal found "overwhelming" evidence that Staley had a close relationship with Epstein and that Staley "acted recklessly" in approving a letter containing misleading statements to regulators.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents and regulatory findings without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Regulatory Status

**UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA):**
Staley was banned from performing any senior management or significant influence function in the UK financial services industry and fined £1.1 million (reduced from £1.8 million) in July 2025.

**Regulatory Breaches Found:**
- Individual Conduct Rule (ICR) 1: Failed to act with integrity
- Individual Conduct Rule (ICR) 3: Failed to be open and cooperative with regulators
- Senior Manager Conduct Rule (SMCR) 4: Failed to disclose information the FCA would reasonably expect

### Email Communications (2008-2015)

**[FCA Decision Notice](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/uk-fca/fca-decision-notice-jes-staley-2023.pdf), dated 30 May 2023:**

Total documented communications: More than 1,700 emails over seven years.

> "I deeply appreciate our friendship. I have few so profound."

(Staley email to Epstein, November 1, 2009, sent from Epstein's New Mexico ranch)

> "We count you as one of our deepest friends. And most honest of people."

(Staley email to Epstein, March 5, 2011)

> "To my most cherished friend."

(Staley email to Epstein, August 23, 2012)

> "The strength of a Greek army was that its core held shoulder to shoulder, and would not flee or break, no matter the threat. That is us."

(Staley email to Epstein, January 31, 2015)

### The Misleading Letter (October 2019)

**[FCA Final Notice](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/uk-fca/fca-final-notice-jes-staley-2025.pdf), dated 23 July 2025:**

> "Mr Staley acted recklessly in approving a letter sent by Barclays to the Authority on 8 October 2019 which contained two misleading statements about the nature of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and the point of their last contact."

The two misleading statements were:
1. "Mr Staley did not have a close relationship with Mr Epstein"
2. "Mr Staley ceased contact with Mr Epstein well before he joined Barclays"

**Reality according to FCA findings:** Staley was in contact with Epstein in the days leading up to the October 28, 2015 announcement of his appointment as Barclays CEO.

### Upper Tribunal Findings

**[Upper Tribunal Judgment](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/uk-fca/upper-tribunal-staley-v-fca-2025.pdf), Staley v FCA [2025] UKUT 00203 (TCC), dated 26 June 2025:**

> "The evidence that Mr Staley had a close relationship with Mr Epstein is overwhelming."

> "Mr Staley had a clear motive for downplaying the relationship."

> "The Tribunal found that some of Mr Staley's evidence lacked credibility, and that he has shown no remorse for his conduct."

### Visits to Epstein Properties

**FCA Decision Notice (2023):**

Documented visits to Epstein properties include:

1. **Little St. James Island, U.S. Virgin Islands:**
   - 2005 or 2006: Overnight visit with family member via private plane
   - January 21-22, 2011: Visit with access to island facilities
   - April 12, 2015: Three-hour visit with family member

2. **Palm Beach, Florida:**
   - January 2009: Visit during Epstein's work release from prison
   - January 20, 2010: Birthday celebration for Epstein

3. **New Mexico Ranch:**
   - November 1, 2009: Stayed at Epstein's property (Epstein not present)

4. **New York City Residence:**
   - Regular visits for dinners and meetings (2008-2015)

### JPMorgan Role

**[USVI v. JPMorgan Second Amended Complaint](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/jpmorgan/usvi-v-jpmorgan-second-amended-complaint-2023-04-12.pdf), filed 12 April 2023:**

> "More than 1,100 emails [were] exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and Jes Staley from Staley's JPMorgan email account between July 2008 and December 2012."

The complaint details that Staley:
- Served as CEO of JPMorgan's Private Bank when Epstein was a client
- Visited Epstein while he was incarcerated in Florida (2009)
- Received photos of young women from Epstein via email
- Discussed human trafficking allegations with Epstein in 2011 and accepted Epstein's denials

### "Snow White" Exchange (July 2010)

**USVI v. JPMorgan Second Amended Complaint:**

> "Staley sent an email to Epstein from his JPMorgan email account stating: 'Maybe they're tracking u? That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.'"

Epstein responded: "[W]hat character would you like next?"

Staley answered: "Beauty and the Beast."

Epstein replied: "well one side is available."

### JPMorgan's Internal Concerns

**USVI v. JPMorgan Second Amended Complaint:**

> "January 2011: AML compliance director requested re-approval for Epstein relationship from [General Counsel Stephen] Cutler 'in light of the new allegations of human trafficking.'"

> "March 2011: Global Corporate Security reported 'Numerous articles detail various law enforcement agencies investigating Jeffrey Epstein for allegedly participating, directly or indirectly, in child trafficking and molesting underage girls.'"

> "Senior compliance official: 'Lots of smoke. Lots of questions.'"

JPMorgan terminated the Epstein relationship in July 2013, months after Staley departed the bank.

### Prior Regulatory Action

**FCA/PRA Joint Press Release, 11 May 2018:**

Staley was previously fined £642,430 for attempting to identify a whistleblower at Barclays in 2016. This was the first major test of the UK's Senior Managers Regime.

### Staley's Departure from Barclays

On November 1, 2021, Staley resigned from Barclays following preliminary FCA/PRA findings. The board determined his position was "untenable."

Barclays subsequently forfeited approximately £40 million in Staley's unvested bonuses and share awards.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the nature of the relationship:** We view the email evidence as demonstrating a relationship that went far beyond professional banking services. In our assessment, when a senior banker describes a client as "my most cherished friend" and speaks of "few friendships so profound," characterizing that relationship to regulators as "not close" and merely "professional" strains credulity.

**Regarding the timing of cessation:** We interpret the evidence as showing that Staley's claim of ending contact "well before" joining Barclays was inaccurate. The FCA found contact continued until days before his CEO appointment was announced. In our view, this discrepancy is material.

**Regarding the institutional context:** We assess that Staley's role at JPMorgan placed him at the center of the bank's decision to maintain Epstein as a client despite documented compliance concerns about trafficking allegations. The timing of JPMorgan's termination of Epstein—shortly after Staley's departure—appears, in our judgment, to be more than coincidental.

**Regarding the "Snow White" exchange:** The Virgin Islands complaint suggests these were code words for young women. Staley's lawyers denied any codeword usage. We take no position on the meaning of these exchanges, but we note that the Upper Tribunal found Staley's inability to remember these emails undermined his credibility.

**Regarding accountability:** We view Staley's case as demonstrating that the UK's Senior Managers Regime can hold individual executives personally accountable for misleading regulators, even when the underlying conduct (maintaining a friendship) may not itself be unlawful. In our assessment, the prohibition and fine reflect the FCA's view that integrity and candor with regulators are non-negotiable requirements for senior executives.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record establishes, in our view, that Staley maintained an unusually close personal relationship with a convicted sex offender for years after that conviction, attempted to minimize the relationship when it became reputationally inconvenient, and paid a significant professional and financial price when the truth emerged. The Upper Tribunal's unanimous dismissal of his appeal suggests the regulatory case against him was robust.

## Alternative Interpretations

Given that Staley contested the FCA's findings and the Upper Tribunal dismissed his appeal, the scope for alternative interpretations is somewhat limited. However, reasonable observers might consider:

1. **Professional context defense:** Staley argued that warm language in emails reflected banking relationship-building norms rather than genuine personal closeness. The Tribunal rejected this interpretation, but some might argue that client relationship emails are inherently performative.

2. **Subjective definition of "close":** Staley's lawyers argued that "close" is a subjective term. One person's "close friend" might be another's "professional acquaintance." The Tribunal found the emails demonstrated objective closeness, but definitional ambiguity remains.

3. **Disclosure timing nuance:** Staley claimed he disclosed his Epstein relationship to Barclays. The issue was characterization, not concealment. Some might argue the FCA focused excessively on word choices rather than the substance of disclosure.

4. **No finding of criminal involvement:** The FCA explicitly stated it "makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein's alleged crimes." Staley maintains he would not have continued the relationship if he had known about Epstein's activities.

5. **Recklessness vs. intent:** The FCA found Staley acted "recklessly," not intentionally, in approving the misleading letter. Some might view this as a meaningful distinction that should affect the severity of sanctions.

6. **Disproportionate punishment:** Staley lost approximately £40 million in compensation and was banned for life from UK financial services. Some might argue this punishment is disproportionate to the underlying conduct of mischaracterizing a personal relationship.

7. **Selective enforcement:** Others with documented Epstein connections (in business, politics, and philanthropy) have not faced comparable regulatory action. Some might question whether Staley was singled out due to his high profile and regulatory jurisdiction rather than the uniqueness of his conduct.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
