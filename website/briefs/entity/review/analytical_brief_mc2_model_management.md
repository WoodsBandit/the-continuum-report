## Statement of Public Interest

MC2 Model Management operated as an international modeling agency from 2005 to 2019 with offices in New York City, Miami, and Tel Aviv. The agency received $1-2 million in startup funding from Jeffrey Epstein according to sworn deposition testimony. Its founder, Jean-Luc Brunel, was arrested in France in December 2020 on charges including rape, sexual assault, and human trafficking involving minors; he died in custody in February 2022 before trial.

Court documents from civil litigation contain allegations that the agency was used as part of a trafficking operation. The agency maintained legitimate business relationships with major retailers including Nordstrom, Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, and others. The intersection of documented fashion industry operations with serious allegations in court filings makes this analysis relevant to understanding how criminal enterprises may operate within legitimate business structures.

These documents were made public through civil litigation and investigative journalism in the public interest. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse regarding documented patterns of exploitation.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of court filings, sworn deposition testimony, and published investigative accounts, MC2 Model Management appears to have operated as a functioning modeling agency with major retail clients while simultaneously receiving substantial financial backing from Jeffrey Epstein. The documentary record suggests a dual-purpose structure: legitimate modeling operations that provided cover, credibility, and access, while allegations in court filings describe the agency as part of a coordinated trafficking network.

In our assessment, the agency's structure represents a documented case study in how legitimate business operations may potentially serve as infrastructure for exploitation. The evidence includes: Epstein's $1-2 million investment, model housing in Epstein-controlled apartments, international recruitment networks with scouts across multiple continents, and court filings alleging the agency was used to traffic minors. The agency dissolved shortly after Epstein's July 2019 arrest, with its assets transferred to successor entities run by former MC2 executives.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Founding and Financial Structure

**Basic Corporate Information:**
- **Founded:** 2005 (transformed from Karin Models U.S. division)
- **Founder:** Jean-Luc Brunel
- **Business Partner:** Jeffrey Fuller
- **Principal Offices:** New York City, Miami, Tel Aviv
- **Dissolved:** September 27, 2019

**Maritza Vasquez Sworn Deposition (2010):**

Maritza Vasquez served as bookkeeper for MC2 Model Management from 2003 to 2006 and provided sworn deposition testimony regarding the agency's finances:

> Jeffrey Epstein invested $1 million in MC2 Model Management.

The payment occurred in 2004-2005 to launch MC2. According to published accounts, Brunel and his business partner Jeffrey Fuller initially denied receiving any payment from Epstein when asked in 2007. Some reports suggest the total investment may have been as high as $2 million.

**Agency Name Etymology:**

According to multiple published accounts, the agency name "MC2" is a reference to Einstein's equation E=mc squared, with the "E" representing Epstein—symbolic branding of his ownership and control.

### Model Housing Arrangements

**Maritza Vasquez Sworn Deposition (2010):**

> MC2 housed models in Epstein's Manhattan apartments.

The address 301 East 66th Street, New York was identified in deposition testimony as housing for years for young models associated with the agency. This arrangement gave Epstein direct access to models under the guise of professional accommodation.

### International Recruitment Network

**Maritza Vasquez Sworn Deposition (2010):**

The former bookkeeper testified under oath regarding MC2's international recruitment operations:

> Brunel employed scouts in South America, Europe, and the former Soviet Union to find models to bring to the United States.

### Court Filing Allegations

**[ECF Doc. 1325-3](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1325-3.pdf), Giuffre v. Maxwell Joinder Motion, filed 12/30/14:**

> "Another person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc Brunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein's closest friends and a regular traveling companion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world."

> "Brunel has been a model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. passports for young girls to 'work' as models. He would bring young girls (ranging to ages as young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein."

**U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Complaint Allegations:**

> "Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, and others deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money."

Virginia Giuffre alleged in a 2014 court filing that the MC2 system was a cover for sex trafficking.

### Deposition Fifth Amendment Invocations

**[ECF Doc. 1328-44](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-44.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Questions regarding Jean-Luc Brunel's activities resulted in Fifth Amendment invocations:

> Q: Each time that Jean Luc Brunel visits Jeffrey Epstein's house, does he bring underage minors to Jeffrey Epstein's house to engage in [sexual activity]?
> A: Fifth.

### Virginia Giuffre's Testimony Regarding Brunel

**2016 Deposition (made public in 2019):**

> Epstein and Maxwell directed Virginia Giuffre to provide sexual services for Brunel "at many places."

**NBC's "Dateline" Interview (2019):**

> Epstein told her he had "slept with over a thousand women that Brunel brought in."

**2015 Affidavit:**

Virginia Giuffre claimed Epstein bragged about sleeping with "over 1,000 of Brunel's girls."

### The "Triplets" Allegation

**Virginia Roberts Giuffre Court Testimony:**

> Jean-Luc Brunel flew 12-year-old triplets from France to the United States as a "birthday present" for Jeffrey Epstein.

### Visa and Passport Scheme Allegations

**Virginia Giuffre Court Filings:**

> Brunel "appeared to have an arrangement with the U.S. Government where he could get passports or other travel documents for young girls."

> He would bring young girls "ranging in age from 12 to 24" to the United States for sexual purposes and "farm them out to his friends, including Epstein."

**November 2020 Prosecutor Subpoena:**

Prosecutors subpoenaed Brunel for:

> "any and all Documents, Materials, or Communications related to any visas or immigration documents for any females contracted, hired, or employed by you or any modeling agency with which you were involved."

**Rental Scheme Allegations:**

> "Epstein and Brunel brought underage girls from all over the world, promising them modeling contracts. Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls; they would charge the underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in the condos."

### Major Retail Client Relationships

**Bloomberg Reporting (August 2019):**

MC2 maintained legitimate business relationships with major retailers:

- Nordstrom (last worked with MC2 in January 2017)
- Macy's Inc.
- Saks Fifth Avenue
- Neiman Marcus
- JCPenney Co.
- Kohl's Corporation
- Target Corporation
- Sears
- Belk

### Client Concerns (2014)

By 2014, Brunel's business partner Jeff Fuller received a "tremendous amount of worries from our clients" about ties to Epstein, indicating that the relationship was damaging the agency's reputation even before Epstein's 2019 arrest.

### Brunel's Jail Visits (2008-2009)

During Epstein's 13-month jail sentence in 2008-2009 for "procuring an underage girl for prostitution," Jean-Luc Brunel visited Epstein at Palm Beach County jail at least 70 recorded times.

### Brunel's Flight Log Presence

**Epstein Private Aircraft Records (1998-2005):**

Jean-Luc Brunel was listed as a passenger on Epstein's private plane for 25 trips during this period.

### Earlier Allegations Against Brunel

**60 Minutes Investigation (1988):**

Jean-Luc Brunel was the subject of a 60 Minutes investigation for sexual assault allegations a decade before founding MC2.

**Michael Gross, "Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women" (1995):**

> "At Karins, many models claimed that Brunel had sexually exploited them."

**John Casablancas (Elite Model Management founder):**

> "Everyone knew [he was] a creep... [he] should be behind bars."

### Corporate Dissolution and Asset Sales

**Following Epstein's Death (August 2019):**

- **2017:** MC2 entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with The Identity Models, Inc.
- **September 27, 2019:** MC2 officially dissolved
- **Fall 2019:** MC2 Miami's assets were sold to The Source Models, run by MC2 executives Jeff Fuller and Petra Pedraza

According to The Daily Beast, while authorities hunted for Brunel in France, he was quietly selling off the agency's assets.

- His lawyers stated his "decision was not guided by guilt, but by a sense of injustice"
- Died before facing trial

### Victim Testimony: Thysia Huisman

**Dutch Model Testimony (Filed 2019):**

Thysia Huisman, a Dutch former model from Leiden, Netherlands, was the first plaintiff to report Brunel to French authorities in 2019. She testified that in September 1991, when she had just turned 18:

- Met Brunel through the Models Office in Brussels
- Agency owners said she "must see him"
- Brunel told her she was "so special" she should stay in his apartment in Paris
- On the fourth or fifth night, Brunel spiked her drink and raped her

Following her report, 11 other victims came forward.

**Huisman's Statement on Brunel's Death (February 2022):**

> "It makes me angry, because I've been fighting for years."
> "For me, the end of this was to be in court."
> "Now that whole ending—which would help form closure—is taken away from me."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the business structure:** We view MC2 Model Management as exhibiting characteristics of what prosecutors sometimes call a "front operation"—a legitimate business that provides cover for illicit activities. The agency had real clients (major retailers), real contracts, and real models. In our assessment, this legitimacy made it an effective vehicle for the alleged trafficking activities described in court filings. The legitimate operations provided access, credibility, and a legal framework for bringing young women into the United States.

**Regarding the financial investment:** Epstein's $1-2 million investment in MC2, combined with the naming convention ("E" for Epstein in MC2), represents in our view more than a passive investment. The symbolic branding suggests ownership and control. The model housing in Epstein-controlled apartments created direct access to agency talent. We interpret this as a structure designed to facilitate exploitation while maintaining plausible deniability through legitimate business operations.

**Regarding the international recruitment network:** The testimony that Brunel employed scouts in South America, Europe, and the former Soviet Union to find models mirrors classic trafficking patterns. In our assessment, targeting economically disadvantaged regions with promises of lucrative modeling careers is a documented recruitment tactic. The visa sponsorship created immigration dependency that made victims vulnerable to exploitation.

**Regarding the control mechanisms:** The documentary record reveals a multi-layered control structure: visa dependency (immigration status tied to agency sponsorship), housing dependency (living in Epstein-controlled apartments), financial dependency (rent charged to young women), and geographic isolation (far from home and support networks). We view these overlapping dependencies as consistent with trafficking victim control patterns.

**Regarding Brunel's documented history:** The 1988 60 Minutes investigation, the 1995 published accounts of exploitation at Karin Models, and John Casablancas's contemporaneous assessment that Brunel "should be behind bars" suggest a pattern of behavior that predated MC2 by decades. In our view, Epstein's investment in Brunel's new agency occurred with knowledge of this history.

**Regarding law enforcement response:** We observe that Brunel continued operating MC2 for years after Epstein's 2008 conviction, visiting Epstein 70 times in jail while maintaining legitimate retail relationships. The agency was not investigated as part of the 2008 prosecution despite the documented financial connections. This raises questions about the scope of the original investigation.

**Regarding the timing of dissolution:** MC2's dissolution in September 2019—less than two months after Epstein's arrest and one month after his death—strongly suggests to us that the agency could not survive scrutiny following Epstein's arrest. The transfer of assets to successor agencies run by former MC2 executives indicates business continuity concerns rather than voluntary closure.

**Regarding deaths before justice:** Both Jeffrey Epstein (August 2019) and Jean-Luc Brunel (February 2022) died in custody before trial. This pattern denied victims their day in court and left allegations against both MC2's financier and its founder forever untested. We note that these deaths also shielded potential co-conspirators from testimony the two men might have provided.

**Our editorial judgment:** MC2 Model Management represents, in our assessment, a documented case study in how legitimate business infrastructure can potentially facilitate exploitation. The combination of major retail clients, Epstein's financial backing, model housing in Epstein-controlled apartments, international recruitment from economically disadvantaged regions, and the serious allegations in court filings presents a pattern worthy of public examination. However, we emphasize that MC2 as an entity was never criminally charged, and the allegations against Brunel were never adjudicated due to his death.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing the same documentary record might conclude:

1. **Legitimate business operations:** MC2 was a functioning modeling agency with major retail clients including Nordstrom, Macy's, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Its business operations may have been entirely legitimate, separate from any personal conduct by its founder or investors. Many investors in legitimate businesses have been accused of unrelated crimes.

2. **Standard industry practices:** International recruitment networks, model housing arrangements, and investor relationships are common in the modeling industry. These practices do not inherently indicate wrongdoing. The fashion industry has historically operated this way.

3. **Civil allegations versus adjudicated facts:** The allegations in court filings represent claims by plaintiffs in civil litigation, not adjudicated facts. MC2 as an entity was never criminally charged. Civil litigation filings present one party's characterization and are subject to adversarial challenge.

4. **Founder's presumption of innocence:** Jean-Luc Brunel died before trial. The presumption of innocence applies, and the charges against him were never proven in court. His lawyers stated his death was driven by "a sense of injustice" rather than guilt.

5. **Investor not operator:** Epstein's investment in MC2 does not necessarily mean he controlled day-to-day operations or that the agency was complicit in any of his documented crimes. Passive investors typically have limited involvement in business operations.

6. **Practical reasons for dissolution:** The agency's dissolution following Epstein's arrest may reflect business necessity—loss of clients, reputational damage, difficulty securing talent—rather than any admission of wrongdoing. The "tremendous amount of worries from clients" documented as early as 2014 suggests business pressures predated Epstein's arrest.

7. **Successor operations indicate legitimacy:** The sale of MC2's assets to other modeling agencies run by former MC2 executives suggests the business model itself was viewed as legitimate and worth continuing under different branding.

8. **Retail clients conducted due diligence:** Major retailers like Nordstrom and Macy's have compliance departments that vet business partners. Their continued relationships with MC2 may indicate the agency passed standard industry scrutiny.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
