## Statement of Public Interest

Alexander Acosta served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009, during which time his office negotiated and approved the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein. This agreement has been described as one of the most controversial prosecutorial decisions in modern American legal history. In February 2019, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that federal prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by concealing the NPA from identified victims. The DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility subsequently investigated the conduct of Acosta and other prosecutors, releasing its findings in November 2020. Acosta's later service as Secretary of Labor and his July 2019 resignation amid renewed scrutiny of the Epstein matter amplify the public interest in understanding his role. These documents derive from federal court proceedings, judicial rulings, and government reports—all matters of significant public concern. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** R. Alexander Acosta served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009 and later as U.S. Secretary of Labor from 2017 to 2019. In our assessment, Acosta's most consequential professional decision was approving the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, which allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state prostitution charges while avoiding federal sex trafficking prosecution.

Based on our review of the documentary record, Acosta's office negotiated an agreement that: (1) protected Epstein from federal prosecution on charges that could have resulted in substantial prison time; (2) granted immunity to four named co-conspirators and "any potential co-conspirators"; (3) was concealed from identified victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act according to Judge Marra's 2019 ruling; and (4) resulted in Epstein serving approximately 13 months in county jail with generous work release privileges.

The November 2020 DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility report concluded that Acosta exercised "poor judgment" in crafting the plea agreement but did not commit professional misconduct or violate any laws. The OPR found that the NPA was "a flawed mechanism" and that Acosta's "view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrow." Acosta has never been criminally charged. He resigned as Secretary of Labor on July 19, 2019, following renewed public scrutiny when Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in New York.

### The Federal Investigation (2006-2007)

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

The Palm Beach Police Department began investigating Epstein in 2005. According to the OPR Report:

> "The Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein in 2005, after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage."

The case was referred to federal authorities after local police were dissatisfied with state handling:

> "because the PBPD Chief and the lead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Attorney's handling of the case and believed that the state grand jury's charge did not address the totality of Epstein's conduct, they referred the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal investigation."

The FBI developed a substantial case:

> "The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with her supervisor's approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta. She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course of the investigation, they discovered additional victims."

By May 2007, the lead AUSA had prepared serious charges:

> "In May 2007, the AUSA submitted to her supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a lengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and addressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges."

### The Non-Prosecution Agreement (September 24, 2007)

**[2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2008-EPSTEIN-FLORIDA-NPA-NON-PROSECUTION-AGREEMENT.pdf):**

The NPA enumerated the federal offenses under investigation, including:

> "knowingly and willfully conspiring with others known and unknown to commit an offense against the United States, that is, to use a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knowingly persuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422(b)"

The agreement specified the immunity provision:

> "In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova."

The NPA contained an unusual secrecy provision:

> "The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure."

### Sentencing Terms

**[2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2008-EPSTEIN-FLORIDA-NPA-NON-PROSECUTION-AGREEMENT.pdf):**

The NPA specified:

> "Epstein shall make a binding recommendation that the Court impose a thirty (30) month sentence to be divided as follows: (a) Epstein shall be sentenced to consecutive terms of twelve (12) months and six (6) months in county jail for all charges, without any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing, and without probation or community control in lieu of imprisonment; and (b) Epstein shall be sentenced to a term of twelve (12) months of community control consecutive to his two terms in county jail"

Regarding gain time credits:

> "Epstein agrees that he will not be afforded any benefits with respect to gain time, other than the rights, opportunities, and benefits as any other inmate, including but not limited to, eligibility for gain time credit based on standard rules and regulations that apply in the State of Florida."

### DOJ OPR Findings on Acosta's Role

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

The OPR explicitly identified Acosta's responsibility:

> "Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA."

> "Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knowledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved the NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions."

### OPR Conclusions: No Professional Misconduct But "Poor Judgment"

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

The OPR found no professional misconduct but delivered significant criticism:

> "OPR concludes that Acosta's decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of Acosta's broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its investigation of Epstein."

The report detailed specific failures:

> "Acosta failed to consider the difficulties inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the consideration required under the circumstances."

> "In sum, Acosta's application of federalism principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA."

The OPR also found inadequate supervision:

> "Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided."

### OPR Findings on Victim Treatment

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

> "Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or the NPA prior to its signing."

The report noted that this failure had significant consequences:

> "the lack of consultation was part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government's treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the Department's mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure."

Regarding Acosta's decision to defer victim notification to state authorities:

> "OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal investigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally sought to silence the victims."

The overall conclusion on victim treatment:

> "In sum, OPR concludes that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the Department."

### OPR Finding: No Evidence of Corruption

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

The OPR investigated whether improper factors influenced the NPA:

> "OPR did not find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, such as Epstein's wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration requirements."

Regarding the controversial "breakfast meeting" with Epstein's defense counsel:

> "OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta's 'breakfast meeting' with one of Epstein's defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein."

### Epstein's Actual Sentence and Work Release

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

> "Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's work release program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2008, Epstein began spending 12 hours a day purportedly working at the 'Florida Science Foundation,' an entity Epstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of Epstein's attorneys."

> "Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein received 'gain time,' that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than 13 months of incarceration."

### Judge Kenneth Marra's CVRA Ruling (February 21, 2019)

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

> "On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the victims about its intention to enter into the NPA. The court also found that letters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, 'mislead [sic] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.'"

### Reference in Giuffre v. Maxwell Documents

**[ECF Doc. 1331-36](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-36.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Jeffrey Epstein's Motion to Quash Trial Subpoena):

In a footnote discussing media attention surrounding Epstein, his attorneys wrote:

> "A Google search for 'Jeffrey Epstein' returns 508,000 entries, the most recent of which center on the new nominee for Secretary of Labor, Alexander Acosta, who, when he was United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, approved Mr. Epstein's nonprosecution agreement. See, e.g., New York Daily News, 'Labor Secretary nominee Alexander Acosta gave "sweetheart deal" to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein,' February 16, 2017."

### Acosta's July 2019 Press Conference

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

> "On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO's actions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office 'was ready to allow Epstein to walk free with no jail time, nothing.' According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a resolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims with the means to obtain monetary damages."

### Resignation as Secretary of Labor (July 2019)

**[DOJ OPR Report](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/florida-case/2020-DOJ-OPR-REPORT-EPSTEIN-NPA-INVESTIGATION.pdf), November 2020:**

> "Acosta's press conference did not end the controversy, however, and on July 12, 2019, Acosta submitted to the President his resignation as Secretary of Labor. In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention on his handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor Department."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the Non-Prosecution Agreement:** In our view, the 2008 NPA negotiated under Acosta's leadership represents a striking deviation from standard federal prosecution practice for sex crimes involving multiple minor victims. The OPR's own language—describing the NPA as "a flawed mechanism" and finding that Acosta's "view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrow"—supports this assessment. The agreement's key features—immunity for unnamed co-conspirators, concealment from victims, state rather than federal charges, minimal jail time with work release—appear, in our assessment, to have been extraordinarily favorable to the defendant given the scope of alleged criminal conduct documented in the draft 60-count federal indictment.

**Regarding the immunity provision:** The NPA granted immunity not only to four named co-conspirators (Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and Nadia Marcinkova) but also to "any potential co-conspirators." In our view, this extraordinarily broad immunity shield foreclosed future prosecution of individuals whose identities and roles may not have been fully understood at the time. This provision appears to have been designed primarily to protect Epstein's network rather than to serve any legitimate prosecutorial interest.

**Regarding the secrecy provision:** The NPA's explicit anticipation that it "will not be made part of any public record" and the agreement to notify Epstein before any disclosure represents, in our interpretation, an unusual prosecutorial concession. Combined with the failure to notify victims, this secrecy provision gave the impression—whether intended or not—of an arrangement designed to shield a wealthy defendant from public accountability.

**Regarding the CVRA violation:** Judge Marra's finding that prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by concealing the NPA from victims suggests, in our interpretation, a deliberate decision to exclude victims from a process in which they had statutory rights to participate. The OPR's finding that Acosta exercised "poor judgment" in failing to ensure victims were notified about the state plea hearing reinforces this assessment.

**Regarding the OPR findings:** We observe that the OPR report concluded Acosta exercised "poor judgment" without finding professional misconduct. The distinction appears to reflect the difficulty of establishing ethical violations in the context of prosecutorial discretion, where courts generally afford prosecutors wide latitude. However, the OPR's substantive criticisms—that the NPA was "flawed," that Acosta's view of federal interest was "too narrow," and that his understanding of the state system was "too imperfect"—constitute a significant institutional rebuke, even without a finding of misconduct.

**Regarding Acosta's defense:** Acosta's July 2019 press conference defense—that the alternative to the NPA might have been no jail time at all—represents one interpretation of the prosecutorial calculus. We note that this explanation does not address why co-conspirators received such broad immunity, why victims were not consulted, why the agreement was kept secret, or why a prosecutor with a draft 60-count federal indictment would defer to state authorities he believed were preparing to let the defendant "walk free."

**Regarding the timing of accountability:** We observe that substantive public accountability for the 2008 NPA did not occur until after Acosta was nominated for Secretary of Labor in 2017, and intensified only after Epstein's 2019 arrest. This eleven-year gap between the agreement and meaningful scrutiny raises questions, in our view, about institutional oversight of prosecutorial decisions.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record supports characterizing the 2008 NPA as an unusual and consequential prosecutorial decision that prioritized closure over accountability. The OPR's findings of "poor judgment," its characterization of the NPA as "flawed," Judge Marra's CVRA ruling, and the subsequent reopening of federal investigation suggest institutional acknowledgment that the process was deficient. However, the question of whether Acosta's decisions reflected mere poor judgment, systemic bias favoring wealthy defendants, or other factors remains a matter of interpretation on which reasonable observers may differ.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Prosecutorial discretion is intentionally broad.** Acosta may have made reasonable professional judgments about evidence quality, trial risks, and resource constraints. The OPR explicitly found no evidence of corruption or improper considerations. The decision to accept a state plea may have reflected genuine assessment that federal charges were harder to prove than they appeared. Prosecutors routinely make such calculations without facing public scrutiny.

2. **The OPR finding exonerates more than it condemns.** The Office of Professional Responsibility explicitly found no professional misconduct and no legal violations. "Poor judgment" is a lesser finding that acknowledges disagreement with the decision while stopping well short of finding it improper. Many prosecutorial decisions could be characterized as reflecting "poor judgment" in hindsight.

3. **The CVRA ruling was subsequently modified.** The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, ruled that CVRA rights do not attach until formal charges are filed. Because federal charges were never filed against Epstein, the appeals court's interpretation limits the significance of Judge Marra's original ruling. This appellate decision affects the legal assessment of whether Acosta violated victims' rights.

4. **Acosta faced genuine prosecutorial challenges.** The 2008 case involved minors who might be reluctant to testify, potential impeachment issues, and a defendant with substantial legal resources. Acosta's stated concern that the state case alone might have resulted in no jail time reflects legitimate prosecutorial calculation. The OPR acknowledged that the USAO "resisted defense efforts" and "refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration requirements."

5. **The 2019 indictment reflects different evidence, not the same case.** The SDNY charges against Epstein in 2019 may have been supported by evidence that was not available or not as developed in 2008. The Miami Herald's investigative journalism and additional victim cooperation in subsequent years may have strengthened the federal case in ways not possible a decade earlier.

6. **Political context may have influenced public perception.** Acosta's nomination to the Trump administration brought renewed scrutiny to a decade-old decision. Some criticism may have been politically motivated rather than based solely on the merits of the 2008 prosecutorial decision.

7. **The alternative to the NPA remains unknown.** Without the NPA, Epstein might have been acquitted at trial, fled prosecution, or received a lighter sentence in a state-only proceeding. The OPR found that Acosta's concerns about state handling were not unfounded. Counterfactual arguments about what "should have" happened cannot be definitively resolved.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
