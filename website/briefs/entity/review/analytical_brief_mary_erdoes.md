## Statement of Public Interest

Mary Erdoes is one of the most powerful women in global finance, serving as CEO of JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management, a division overseeing more than $4 trillion in client assets. She was referenced in the U.S. Virgin Islands' complaint against JPMorgan Chase regarding the bank's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The litigation alleged that decisions to maintain Epstein's accounts were "advocated and approved at the senior levels of JP Morgan." The case settled for $75 million in September 2023, with no admission of liability. As a senior executive named in publicly filed federal court documents regarding institutional accountability for alleged facilitation of trafficking, this analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Mary Erdoes serves as CEO of JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management and is one of the longest-tenured senior executives at JPMorgan Chase. Based on our review of civil litigation records, she was referenced in the USVI v. JPMorgan complaint in connection with decisions to maintain Jeffrey Epstein's banking accounts. The complaint alleged that senior executives at JPMorgan, including those in asset management, were part of an executive chain informed about the Epstein relationship and concerns raised by compliance personnel. In our assessment, Erdoes was named as part of the USVI's theory that institutional liability extended to senior leadership. Notably, unlike former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley, Erdoes has not faced personal regulatory action, criminal charges, or individual lawsuits related to the Epstein matter. She continues to serve in her leadership role at JPMorgan.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Professional Background

**Current Position:**
Mary Callahan Erdoes serves as Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management, a position she has held since September 2009. The division manages more than $4 trillion in client assets and includes JPMorgan's Private Bank, which services ultra-high-net-worth clients.

**Career Timeline at JPMorgan:**
- 1996: Joined JPMorgan
- 2005-2009: CEO of JPMorgan Private Bank
- 2009-Present: CEO of Asset & Wealth Management

Erdoes reports directly to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and is a member of the firm's Operating Committee.

### USVI v. JPMorgan Complaint Allegations

**[USVI v. JPMorgan Complaint](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/financial-enablers/2022-USVI-V-JPMORGAN-COMPLAINT-EPSTEIN-TRAFFICKING.pdf), filed 12/27/22:**

The complaint identified three categories of senior executives referenced in connection with the Epstein account decisions:

> "These decisions were advocated and approved at the senior levels of JP Morgan, including by the former chief executive of its asset management division and investment bank, whose inappropriate relationship with Epstein should have been evident to the bank."

The complaint referenced Erdoes as the "CEO of JPMorgan Asset Management" in connection with decisions to maintain Epstein's accounts.

The complaint alleged that JPMorgan:

> "knowingly facilitated, sustained, and concealed the human trafficking network operated by Jeffrey Epstein from his home and base in the Virgin Islands, and financially benefitted from this participation, directly or indirectly, by failing to comply with federal banking regulations."

### Organizational Context

**JPMorgan's Private Bank Structure:**

Jeffrey Epstein was a client of JPMorgan's Private Bank from approximately 1998 to 2013. During this period, the Private Bank was organizationally part of the Asset Management division.

The complaint noted that Jes Staley served as head of the Private Bank before becoming CEO of Asset Management and the Investment Bank. After Staley's departure from JPMorgan in early 2013, Erdoes remained as CEO of Asset & Wealth Management.

**Timing of Key Events:**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2008 | Epstein pleads guilty to Florida charges; registers as sex offender |
| 2009 | Mary Erdoes becomes CEO of Asset & Wealth Management |
| January 2013 | OCC consent order re: JPMorgan BSA/AML compliance deficiencies |
| Early 2013 | Jes Staley departs JPMorgan |
| July 2013 | JPMorgan terminates Epstein banking relationship |
| December 2022 | USVI files complaint against JPMorgan |
| September 2023 | JPMorgan settles USVI case for $75 million |

### Settlement Outcome

JPMorgan settled the USVI case in September 2023:

- **Settlement amount:** $75 million
- **Admission of liability:** None
- **Individual executive accountability:** No personal claims pursued against Erdoes

The parallel Jane Doe 1 class action settled for $290 million, bringing combined settlements to $365 million.

### No Personal Regulatory or Legal Action

As of the date of this brief:

- Mary Erdoes has not been named as a defendant in any lawsuit related to the Epstein matter
- No regulatory agency has taken enforcement action against Erdoes personally
- No criminal charges have been filed against Erdoes
- Erdoes has not been fined, suspended, or sanctioned
- Erdoes continues to serve in her executive role at JPMorgan

This stands in contrast to Jes Staley, who was:
- Named as a third-party defendant by JPMorgan
- Banned from UK financial services by the FCA
- Fined £1.1 million by UK regulators
- Subject of Upper Tribunal findings regarding his relationship with Epstein

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Erdoes' mention in the complaint:** We view the USVI complaint's reference to Erdoes as part of a broader institutional liability theory, not as an allegation of personal misconduct. The complaint's primary focus was on Jes Staley's documented personal relationship with Epstein. Erdoes' mention appears to reflect her organizational position rather than specific documented interactions with Epstein.

**Regarding the organizational structure:** In our assessment, as CEO of Asset & Wealth Management (which includes the Private Bank), Erdoes occupied a position in the executive hierarchy where she could reasonably have been informed about compliance concerns regarding a high-profile, high-risk client. Whether she was actually informed, and what actions she took if so, is not documented in the public record.

**Regarding the absence of personal liability:** We interpret the absence of personal claims against Erdoes as significant. Unlike Staley, whose extensive email correspondence and personal visits to Epstein were documented, no comparable evidence of personal interaction between Erdoes and Epstein has emerged in the public record. The USVI and plaintiff attorneys, who had access to JPMorgan's internal documents through discovery, did not pursue individual claims against Erdoes.

**Regarding the compliance timeline:** We note that JPMorgan terminated the Epstein relationship in July 2013, approximately five months after Staley's departure and during Erdoes' continued tenure as Asset Management CEO. In our view, this timing could suggest either that Erdoes supported the termination decision or that the decision was driven by factors independent of her involvement.

**Regarding continued employment:** We view Erdoes' continued employment at JPMorgan as indicating either that internal investigation cleared her of wrongdoing, that her involvement was not deemed material, or that JPMorgan made a business judgment that her role did not warrant separation. Without access to internal findings, we cannot determine which interpretation is accurate.

**Our editorial judgment:** Based on the public documentary record, Mary Erdoes occupies a peripheral role in the Epstein-JPMorgan narrative. She was mentioned in litigation filings as part of the institutional leadership structure, but unlike Staley, there is no public evidence of personal communications with Epstein, visits to his properties, or documented awareness of specific compliance concerns. The absence of personal liability claims or regulatory action, despite extensive litigation and discovery, suggests either that evidence of personal involvement does not exist or that it was not deemed sufficient to warrant individual accountability.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

Given Erdoes' status as a senior executive who has never been charged or personally sued, readers might consider multiple interpretations of the available evidence:

1. **Organizational distance:** Erdoes may have been several organizational layers removed from day-to-day decisions about individual client relationships. The Private Bank's client relationship decisions may not have required her personal approval, particularly for clients established before she assumed the Asset Management CEO role.

2. **Knowledge without culpability:** Even if Erdoes was aware of concerns about the Epstein accounts, awareness alone may not constitute legal liability. Banks service many clients with problematic backgrounds, and executives cannot personally investigate every compliance concern.

3. **Reliance on compliance systems:** Erdoes may have reasonably relied on JPMorgan's compliance infrastructure to identify and address problematic accounts. The failure may have been systemic rather than attributable to specific executive decisions.

4. **Post-conviction continuation:** Epstein's accounts continued from 2008 to 2013, after his conviction but during a period when he maintained relationships with many prominent individuals and institutions. The decision to maintain the relationship may have been made by others or may have reflected insufficient information rather than deliberate disregard.

5. **Settlement strategy:** JPMorgan's decision not to pursue contribution claims against Erdoes (as it did against Staley) could reflect either a determination that she was not culpable or a business decision to protect current leadership.

6. **Regulatory silence:** The absence of FCA action against Erdoes (in contrast to Staley) could reflect either jurisdictional limitations (she is based in the U.S.), a lack of evidence of personal misconduct, or different regulatory priorities.

7. **Successful crisis management:** Erdoes' continued employment could reflect that she managed the Epstein matter appropriately once it came to her attention, potentially including supporting the decision to terminate the relationship.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through review of publicly available federal court filings, settlement announcements, regulatory records, and verified news reporting.

**What we did not review:**
- Internal JPMorgan communications or investigation findings
- Discovery materials from USVI v. JPMorgan (not publicly available)
- Any direct communications between Erdoes and Epstein (none appear to exist in the public record)
- Depositions or sworn testimony from Erdoes (if any were taken)
- JPMorgan's internal compliance records regarding the Epstein accounts
- Board discussions regarding executive accountability

**Critical Note:** This brief reflects limited available documentation specifically referencing Mary Erdoes. Unlike the Jes Staley brief, which draws on extensive documented communications and regulatory findings, the Erdoes record consists primarily of organizational references in litigation filings. The absence of documented evidence does not necessarily indicate absence of involvement; it may reflect limitations of the public record or successful assertion of privilege.

**Important Distinction:** Erdoes was referenced in litigation but was never named as a defendant, never faced personal liability claims, and has never been subject to regulatory enforcement action. This brief should not be interpreted as alleging wrongdoing by Erdoes.
