## Statement of Public Interest

The Wexner Foundation is one of the largest Jewish philanthropic organizations in the United States, contributing over $128 million to Israel-related causes between 2003-2018. Jeffrey Epstein served as a trustee of this foundation during the 1990s and 2000s, and the extent of his authority over foundation operations has become a matter of significant public interest. In December 2025, leaked emails obtained by Dropsite News revealed apparent contradictions between the foundation's public statements and documentary evidence regarding Epstein's role. These documents inform ongoing public discourse about institutional accountability and financial oversight.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The Wexner Foundation, founded by retail billionaire Leslie Wexner, publicly claimed in 2019 that it "immediately severed ties" with Jeffrey Epstein following his resignation in September 2007. A 2020 independent review stated Epstein "did not make decisions regarding the use of Foundation's funds." Based on our review of leaked emails published by Dropsite News in December 2025, these statements appear to be contradicted by documentary evidence showing Epstein continued to exercise financial authority over foundation matters through at least January 2008, including advising on a $20 million stock transaction two months after his claimed departure. The leaked emails suggest Epstein's lawyer, Darren Indyke, served as an intermediary routing foundation decisions through Epstein even after his official resignation.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from public documents and investigative journalism without editorial comment.*

### Foundation Background

The Wexner Foundation is a Jewish philanthropic organization established by Leslie and Abigail Wexner. According to Dropsite News reporting, the foundation contributed $128.4 million to Israel-related causes between 2003 and 2018, making it the third-largest pro-Israel donor during that period.

### Wexner's 2019 Public Letter

**[Wexner Foundation Letter](https://www.wexnerfoundation.org/letter-from-les/), August 8, 2019:**

Leslie Wexner stated regarding Epstein's foundation role:

> "In the early 1990s Mr. Epstein became a trustee of The Wexner Foundation, but he had no executive responsibilities in the running of the Foundation. He did not work directly with Foundation staff, and he did not engage with leadership initiatives in any way."

Regarding the severance timeline:

> "As the allegations against Mr. Epstein in Florida were emerging, he vehemently denied them. But by early fall 2007, it was agreed that he should step back from the management of our personal finances."

Regarding the immediate termination:

> "With his credibility and our trust in him destroyed, we immediately severed ties with him."

### 2020 Independent Review Claims

According to Dropsite News, the Wexner Foundation's 2020 independent review conducted by Kegler Brown stated that Epstein "did not make decisions regarding the use of Foundation's funds."

### Leaked Email Evidence (2005-2008)

**[Dropsite News Investigation](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/jeffrey-epstein-leslie-abigail-wexner-pro-israel-philanthropic-foundation), December 2025:**

Emails obtained from a vetted cache provided by Distributed Denial of Secrets revealed the following:

**August 2006 — Grant Approval:**
Foundation Controller Peg Ugland asked Epstein (via lawyer Darren Indyke) to approve a Jewish Media Fund grant. Epstein directed: "pay for foundctiona" (with typos).

**April 2006 — $1 Million Transfer:**
Ugland requested Epstein's approval to transfer $1 million between Wexner accounts at Bear Stearns and JPMorgan.

**March 2007 — Attorney Fee Structure:**
Attorney Charles Miller's invoice was structured at Epstein's direction to charge the Wexners double for fractional work ($200,000 from Wexners, $100,000 from an Epstein entity).

**November 23, 2007 — $20 Million Stock Purchase:**
Two months after Epstein's supposed trustee resignation, he personally advised Abigail Wexner on executing a $20 million Limited Brands stock purchase during a market crisis.

**December 2007 — Continued Financial Counsel:**
Leslie Wexner requested Epstein's counsel on BNY Mellon holdings during an Ohio State board meeting.

**January 1, 2008 — Asset Transfers:**
Epstein-controlled entities transferred approximately $46 million ($12 million in securities plus $34 million in Apple stock) into the newly created YLK Charitable Fund.

### Darren Indyke's Role

**[Dropsite News Investigation](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/jeffrey-epstein-leslie-abigail-wexner-pro-israel-philanthropic-foundation), December 2025:**

Darren Indyke served simultaneously as Epstein's personal lawyer and as Wexner Foundation secretary. According to Dropsite News, Indyke functioned as a middleman, with foundation staff routing decisions through him to Epstein, potentially using attorney-client privilege to obscure Epstein's continuing authority.

### DOJ Document Release

**DOJ Document Release, December 23, 2025:**

Following congressional legislation requiring disclosure of Epstein investigation documents, emails revealed:

**July 7, 2019 — FBI New York Message:**
An FBI New York message asked: "When you get a chance can you give me an update on the status of the 10 CO conspirators?"

Leslie Wexner's name appeared in this thread discussing alleged co-conspirators.

**July 9, 2019 — Violent Crimes Section Email:**
An exchange from the Violent Crimes Section for Crimes Against Children Human Trafficking Unit referenced the "10 co-conspirators" and mentioned a "wealthy business man in Ohio" who had not yet received a subpoena.

### Wexner's Response to DOJ Release

Wexner's legal representative stated that the assistant U.S. attorney overseeing the Epstein investigation stated at that time that Wexner was "not a co-conspirator nor a target in any respect," that Wexner provided background information voluntarily, and that he received no subsequent contact from investigators.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the timeline discrepancy:** We view the November 2007 email evidence as significant. The Wexner Foundation's public statement claimed "immediate" severance after Epstein's September 2007 resignation. In our assessment, an email showing Epstein advising on a $20 million stock transaction two months later directly contradicts the claim of immediate severance.

**Regarding foundation decision-making:** The 2020 independent review stated Epstein "did not make decisions regarding the use of Foundation's funds." We interpret the 2006 emails showing Controller Ugland routing grant approvals through Epstein as inconsistent with this characterization. The pattern of seeking Epstein's authorization for foundation expenditures suggests, in our view, that Epstein exercised substantial decision-making authority.

**Regarding Darren Indyke's intermediary role:** We observe that Indyke's dual position as Epstein's personal lawyer and Foundation secretary created a structure that could obscure Epstein's continuing involvement. Communications routed through an attorney could be shielded by privilege claims, potentially explaining why the independent review reached conclusions that appear contradicted by the underlying emails.

**Regarding the financial magnitude:** The leaked emails reference over $20 million in transactions where Epstein was consulted after his claimed departure, plus the $46 million transfer into YLK Charitable Fund in January 2008. In our assessment, these figures suggest Epstein's financial involvement with Wexner entities continued at significant scale after the publicly stated severance date.

**Regarding the DOJ co-conspirator designation:** The appearance of Wexner's name in FBI communications discussing "10 co-conspirators" is notable, though we observe that his representatives state he was subsequently told he was not a target. The investigation's termination following Epstein's death in August 2019 leaves questions about what further inquiry might have revealed.

**Our editorial judgment:** Based on the leaked email evidence, the Wexner Foundation's public statements about the timing and completeness of its severance from Epstein appear materially inaccurate. The documentary record suggests Epstein retained substantial financial authority over Wexner matters for months after his claimed departure, and the independent review's characterization of his role appears inconsistent with the email evidence.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **Communication vs. Authority:** The 2007-2008 emails may reflect informal consultation rather than formal authority. Wexner may have sought Epstein's opinion on financial matters even after the official relationship ended, without Epstein having decision-making power.

2. **Transitional Period:** The months following September 2007 may represent a wind-down period during which Epstein's involvement was being phased out. Complex financial relationships do not necessarily end instantaneously.

3. **Independent Review Scope:** The Kegler Brown independent review may have examined formal authority structures rather than informal communications. The statement that Epstein did not make foundation decisions could be technically accurate regarding official governance while not capturing informal influence.

4. **Context of Communications:** Emails may not fully capture the context of communications. What appears as Epstein directing decisions may reflect his conveying decisions already made by others.

5. **Selective Evidence:** The leaked emails represent a subset of communications. The full documentary record might provide context that changes the interpretation of specific exchanges.

6. **Legal vs. Actual Practice:** The foundation's public statements may have described the intended or formal relationship while actual practice diverged. This could reflect poor internal controls rather than intentional misrepresentation.

7. **Memory and Reconstruction:** Wexner's 2019 letter was written over a decade after the events described. Statements about "immediate" severance may reflect imperfect recollection rather than deliberate falsehood.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
