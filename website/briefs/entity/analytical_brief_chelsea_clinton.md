## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Clinton was mentioned incidentally.** Her references appear in the context of her family.

- **She is not a subject of the litigation.** The references do not suggest direct involvement.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being mentioned in documents reflects contextual reference, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Clinton.** She appears in documents incidentally.

- **The documentary record is limited.** Two mentions do not provide extensive detail about any role.

- **Family members of public figures often appear in complex litigation.** Such references are typically contextual.

- **The specific nature of the references is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
