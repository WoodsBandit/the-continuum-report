## Statement of Public Interest

The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program represents a significant development in how estates of deceased alleged traffickers address victim restitution. As the primary mechanism through which Jeffrey Epstein's estate compensated survivors following his death in federal custody, the EVCP raises important questions about voluntary compensation programs, release requirements, and the adequacy of financial restitution for trafficking survivors.

The program's design, administration, and outcomes are matters of legitimate public interest given the scale of documented abuse, the prominent figures involved in the Epstein matter, and ongoing debates about how financial institutions and estates should be held accountable for facilitating trafficking. This analysis examines the publicly available record regarding the program's structure and outcomes.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** In our assessment, the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program represented a substantial effort to provide financial restitution to survivors outside the traditional litigation process. The program, designed by Kenneth Feinberg — who previously administered the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and other high-profile compensation programs — and administered by Jordana Feldman, distributed approximately $121-125 million to an estimated 135-150 survivors between June 2020 and August 2021.

Based on our review of available documentation, the EVCP operated with apparent independence from estate executors Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, with payments funded from estate assets including property liquidations. The program's 92% acceptance rate among eligible claimants suggests general satisfaction with offers, though we note that acceptance of compensation required waiving rights to sue the estate and, according to some reports, "people Epstein worked with in trafficking ring" including Ghislaine Maxwell.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding program design:** In our assessment, the selection of Kenneth Feinberg to design the EVCP represented an attempt to provide the program with legitimacy and expertise. Feinberg's track record with high-profile victim compensation programs, including the September 11th fund, suggested an intent to create a credible process. The decision to have Jordana Feldman serve as an independent administrator, separate from estate executors, appears designed to create distance between compensation decisions and potential conflicts of interest.

**Regarding compensation adequacy:** We view the average payment of approximately $800,000-$900,000 as substantial by historical standards for trafficking victim compensation, though we note that no financial amount can adequately compensate for the documented harm. The 92% acceptance rate among eligible claimants suggests that most participants found the offers acceptable under the circumstances, though this acceptance should be understood in the context of the release requirements and the uncertainties of litigation.

**Regarding release requirements:** The requirement that accepting compensation waive rights to sue "people Epstein worked with" raises questions about the program's design. In our assessment, this provision may have protected individuals beyond Epstein himself from civil liability. Whether this was an appropriate trade-off for expedited compensation, or an improper shield for potential co-conspirators, represents a legitimate question.

**Regarding gaps in coverage:** Based on our review, approximately 75 claims were rejected, and an unknown number of victims never filed claims. The estate's estimation of approximately 50 outstanding non-EVCP victim claims suggests the program did not reach all survivors. International victims, victims outside statutes of limitation, and victims who prioritized privacy over compensation may have been systematically underrepresented.

**Regarding executor compensation:** The payment of $250,000 annually to each executor ($3+ million total over 6+ years) represents a significant administrative cost. While within normal ranges for complex estate administration, we note that these payments came from the same asset pool as victim compensation.

**Our editorial judgment:** The EVCP appears to have been a professionally administered program that distributed substantial compensation to many survivors. However, the release provisions, the gaps in coverage, and the ongoing litigation against executors for alleged complicity suggest the program represented partial — not complete — justice. The $121-125 million distributed through EVCP constitutes only about 20-25% of total documented victim compensation across all sources ($461-515 million net), indicating that litigation remained a primary path to compensation for many survivors.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **The program was genuinely victim-centered:** The selection of Feinberg, the independent administrator structure, and the substantial payouts could be viewed as evidence that the estate genuinely prioritized victim compensation. The 92% acceptance rate suggests survivors themselves largely validated the program's legitimacy.

2. **The program primarily served estate interests:** Alternatively, the release requirements could be viewed as the program's primary purpose — protecting the estate and associated individuals from protracted litigation rather than prioritizing victim welfare. Under this interpretation, compensation was the price paid for legal immunity.

3. **The rejected claims represent program rigor:** The rejection of approximately 75 claims (25% of submissions) could indicate careful verification procedures designed to ensure legitimacy of recipients. Alternatively, it could suggest overly restrictive eligibility criteria that excluded genuine victims.

4. **Executor compensation was appropriate:** Given the complexity of liquidating a $636 million estate involving multiple international properties, ongoing litigation, and a victim compensation program, the $500,000 annual executor compensation may represent fair market value for the services provided.

5. **Executor compensation was excessive:** Alternatively, paying estate administrators from the same pool as victim compensation, while those administrators face litigation alleging complicity in trafficking, could be viewed as problematic regardless of market rates.

6. **The program timeline was appropriate:** Operating from June 2020 to August 2021 allowed time for claims processing while providing relatively expedited compensation compared to litigation timelines. The deadline may have created necessary closure.

7. **The program timeline was rushed:** Opening less than a year after Epstein's death and closing within 14 months may not have provided adequate time for all victims — particularly international victims or those still processing trauma — to learn of the program and file claims.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
