## Statement of Public Interest

Ehud Barak served as Prime Minister of Israel (1999-2001) and is the most decorated soldier in Israeli military history. His acknowledged relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including admitted visits to Epstein's private island and documented business partnerships, constitutes a matter of significant public concern. Documents from the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* litigation, unsealed by federal court order in January 2024, include references to Barak. Additionally, leaked emails published by Distributed Denial of Secrets in 2025 reveal extensive correspondence between Barak and Epstein spanning 2007-2016. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse regarding relationships between powerful political figures and Epstein.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of available documentation, Ehud Barak maintained a substantial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that extended well beyond casual acquaintance. Barak has publicly acknowledged visiting Epstein's private Caribbean island, meeting with Epstein dozens of times after Epstein's 2008 conviction, and entering into business partnerships with Epstein. In our assessment, the documentary record suggests a relationship of considerable depth and duration. However, we emphasize that Barak has categorically denied any knowledge of or participation in Epstein's criminal conduct, has never been criminally charged in connection with Epstein, and no court has made any finding against him. The 2024 unsealed documents from *Giuffre v. Maxwell* include his name among those asked about in depositions, but victim Johanna Sjoberg testified she had never met him.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents, interviews, and documented sources without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Background: Military and Political Career

Ehud Barak was born on February 12, 1942, on Kibbutz Mishmar HaSharon in what was then Mandatory Palestine. He served in the Israel Defense Forces for 35 years, becoming Chief of the General Staff (1991-1995) and receiving five decorations, making him the most decorated soldier in Israeli history.

Barak served as Prime Minister of Israel from 1999 to 2001 and later as Defense Minister from 2007 to 2013 under Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Benjamin Netanyahu.

### Giuffre v. Maxwell Court Documents (Unsealed January 2024)

The documents unsealed in January 2024 from *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, No. 15-cv-07433-LAP (S.D.N.Y.), contain references to Ehud Barak.

**Johanna Sjoberg Deposition:**

During her deposition, victim Johanna Sjoberg was asked whether she had met a series of powerful people associated with Epstein. When asked whether she had ever met former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, she replied that she had not.

**Context from Court:**

According to reporting on the unsealed documents, the fact that names are mentioned in the court documents does not imply a link to criminal activities. Many names appeared "in passing, or in settings that are 'not salacious,'" as Senior U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska noted.

### Barak's Acknowledged Relationship with Epstein

**Interview with Daily Beast (July 2019):**

Barak stated: "The man who introduced me to Epstein about 17 years ago was Shimon Peres" at an event where "there were many famous and important people, including, if I recall, both Clintons and hundreds of others."

When asked how many times he met with Epstein, Barak said it was "more than 10 times and much less than a hundred times but I can't tell you exactly how many."

**Visits to Epstein's Private Island:**

Barak acknowledged visiting Epstein's private Caribbean island "once, for several hours -- and years after the publications about sex parties or orgies there."

He stated he was "never involved in any of the parties held at Epstein's island."

**Regarding Women or Minors:**

Barak stated in interviews: "I never participated in any party or any other 'inappropriate' event with him" and "never met him with girls or minors, not even with adult women in the context of any inappropriate behavior."

### Photographs at Epstein's New York Residence (2016)

Photographs published by the Daily Mail show Ehud Barak entering Jeffrey Epstein's New York townhouse in January 2016.

**Barak's Confirmation (Daily Beast interview):**

"It is me in the picture. I was there, for lunch or chat, nothing else."

Regarding his face being partially covered: Barak stated he "had been trying to protect his face from inclement January weather in New York."

**Daily Mail Statement:**

The Daily Mail stated: "We published the story and all the pictures in 2016, but we didn't recognize Ehud Barak... The women arrived on the same day he did, at different times throughout the day he was there. We do not know if Barak knew or not -- this is a 7-floor house, the largest in New York City. So we cannot say he was in the same room or area as they were."

### Business Relationship

**Carbyne Investment (2015-2019):**

In 2015, Barak formed a limited partnership company in Israel called Sum (E.B.) 2015 to invest in Reporty Homeland Security (later renamed Carbyne), which developed video streaming and geolocation software for emergency services.

According to reporting by Israel's Kan public broadcaster and Haaretz, Epstein invested $1 million in Barak's investment vehicle through a British Virgin Islands-registered company named Southern Trust.

Barak invested approximately $1 million in Carbyne, partly bankrolled by Epstein.

### Leaked Emails (2025)

In May 2025, Distributed Denial of Secrets published more than 100,000 emails allegedly from Barak's inbox spanning 2007-2016, leaked by a hacker group called Handala.

**Island Visit Correspondence (as reported by news outlets):**

An email allegedly from Barak in January 2014: "I'm still trying to arrange that the security guys will NOT come with us to the island."

An email allegedly from Barak in December 2014: "Hi Jeff. Thx for the hospitality. Great, impressive island."

**Prior Knowledge of Allegations:**

According to reporting on the leaked emails, in 2015 The Mirror newspaper contacted Barak for comment about whether he was aware that his business partner was "paying underage girls for sex." In a letter sent through his lawyers, Barak denied any knowledge of criminality by Epstein.

### Virginia Giuffre's Allegations

Virginia Giuffre alleged in court filings being sexually assaulted by a "well-known Prime Minister." News outlets have linked this allegation to Barak.

In her posthumous memoir "Nobody's Girl" (published October 2025), Giuffre wrote of an unnamed prime minister: "He repeatedly choked me until I lost consciousness and took pleasure in seeing me fear for my life."

**Barak's Denial:**

In an interview with The New York Times, Barak was asked directly whether Epstein had ever attempted to arrange for a woman or a minor for him. Barak issued an emphatic denial, stating: "No, never."

He also stated: "I now deeply regret having any association with him."

### Barak's Public Statements and Denials

**July 2019 Statement:**

Following Epstein's arrest, Barak announced he had "cut all ties" with Epstein.

Barak's party, Democratic Israel, issued a statement: "Barak disgustedly rejects the loathsome insinuations in this article. Neither the report nor the insinuations have any basis. They are a complete lie."

**2023 Interview with Wall Street Journal:**

Barak "adamantly denied attending any of Epstein's 'parties or activities involving girls and women.'"

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the scope of the relationship:** Based on our review, the relationship between Barak and Epstein appears to have been extensive by Barak's own acknowledgment -- dozens of meetings over many years, visits to multiple residences including the private island, and a significant business partnership. In our assessment, this suggests a relationship that went well beyond casual acquaintance, though the nature of those meetings remains undocumented.

**Regarding the timing:** We note that Barak's relationship with Epstein continued well after Epstein's 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution. The Wall Street Journal reported approximately 30 meetings between 2013 and 2017. In our view, this continuation of the relationship after Epstein's conviction raises questions about judgment, though we cannot know what Barak understood about Epstein's ongoing activities.

**Regarding the leaked emails:** The 2025 leaked emails, if authentic, suggest Barak may have been aware of allegations against Epstein as early as 2015 when contacted by The Mirror for comment. We interpret this as potentially inconsistent with his 2019 statement that he had no knowledge of Epstein's activities, though we acknowledge that receiving media inquiries does not constitute proof of actual knowledge.

**Regarding the allegations:** Virginia Giuffre's allegations against an unnamed "Prime Minister" are serious. However, we emphasize that: (1) Giuffre did not publicly name Barak in these specific allegations; (2) Barak has categorically denied any wrongdoing; (3) no criminal charges have ever been filed against Barak; and (4) no court has made any finding against him.

**Regarding the island visit:** Barak's admission that he visited Epstein's private island -- and the leaked email suggesting he sought to exclude his security detail -- may raise questions. However, we cannot infer criminal activity from the mere fact of a visit, and Barak has stated the visit lasted only "several hours."

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record establishes that Ehud Barak had a significant, long-term relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that continued after Epstein's 2008 conviction and included business partnerships, social visits, and travel to Epstein's private island. This relationship merits public scrutiny given Barak's stature as a former head of state. However, being associated with Epstein -- even closely associated -- is not evidence of participation in his crimes. Barak has never been charged, maintains categorical denials, and victim Johanna Sjoberg testified she never met him.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

**Given Ehud Barak's categorical denials and never having been criminally charged, readers might reasonably consider the following alternative interpretations:**

1. **Business relationship explanation:** Barak may have viewed Epstein purely as a wealthy investor and financial advisor. Many prominent individuals maintained business relationships with Epstein without knowledge of his criminal activities. The Carbyne investment may have been a straightforward business arrangement.

2. **Limited exposure theory:** Barak stated he visited the island "for several hours" on one occasion. A brief visit does not establish awareness of any illegal activity, and Epstein's island also served legitimate purposes including meetings and socializing.

3. **Social circles of the elite:** Epstein cultivated relationships with many prominent figures across politics, academia, and business. Being introduced to Epstein by Shimon Peres at a large gathering reflects the social circles in which Barak operated, not necessarily intimate knowledge of Epstein's crimes.

4. **Temporal context:** Barak met Epstein years after his 2008 conviction, but that conviction was characterized by some as a relatively minor offense (Florida state charges) due to the controversial non-prosecution agreement. Many prominent figures continued associating with Epstein before the full scope of his activities became publicly known in 2019.

5. **Media allegations versus court findings:** Virginia Giuffre's reference to a "well-known Prime Minister" has never been officially confirmed to refer to Barak. The media connection is inferential. Giuffre's memoir withheld the name, and no court proceeding has established this identification.

6. **Political timing:** The July 2019 resurgence of the Daily Mail photographs occurred while Barak was challenging Prime Minister Netanyahu. Barak himself suggested the timing was politically motivated. The allegations should be considered in this context.

7. **Leaked emails provenance:** The hacked emails published in 2025 came from a group called Handala, described as pro-Palestinian hackers targeting Israeli officials. While published by Distributed Denial of Secrets, questions about selective editing or contextualization of cherry-picked emails warrant consideration.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
