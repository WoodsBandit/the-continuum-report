## Statement of Public Interest

MC2 Model Management was a modeling agency that operated from 2005 until its dissolution in 2019. The agency is named in civil litigation related to the Jeffrey Epstein case and received startup funding from Epstein according to sworn deposition testimony. The agency's founder, Jean-Luc Brunel, was arrested in France in December 2020 on charges including rape and human trafficking involving minors; he died in custody in February 2022 before trial.

Court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case contain allegations that the agency was used in connection with trafficking activities. Major retail clients including Nordstrom, Macy's, and others worked with MC2 during its operation. The intersection of legitimate fashion industry operations with these allegations makes this analysis relevant to understanding how exploitation can occur within legitimate business structures.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of court filings, deposition testimony, and investigative reporting, MC2 Model Management appears to have functioned as a legitimate modeling agency with major retail clients while simultaneously receiving financial backing from Jeffrey Epstein. The documentary record suggests that the agency operated at the intersection of the fashion industry and Epstein's documented activities, with its founder Jean-Luc Brunel identified in court filings as part of what plaintiffs characterized as Epstein's network.

In our assessment, the agency's structure—legitimate business operations providing cover for alleged illicit activities—represents a pattern worthy of examination. The agency was dissolved shortly after Epstein's July 2019 arrest, and its assets were sold to successor agencies. MC2 as an entity was never criminally charged.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented facts from court documents and public records without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Corporate History

**Basic Information:**
- **Founded:** 2005 (transformed from Karin Models U.S. division)
- **Founder:** Jean-Luc Brunel
- **Principal Offices:** New York City, Miami, Tel Aviv
- **Dissolved:** September 27, 2019

### Epstein Financial Investment

**Maritza Vasquez Deposition (2010):**

According to sworn deposition testimony from Maritza Vasquez, who served as bookkeeper for MC2 from 2003 to 2006:

> Jeffrey Epstein invested $1 million in MC2 Model Management.

The payment occurred in 2004-2005 to launch MC2. According to published accounts, Brunel and his business partner Jeffrey Fuller initially denied receiving any payment from Epstein in 2007. Vasquez's confirmation came from her direct access to the agency's financial records as bookkeeper. Some published reports suggest the total investment may have been as high as $2 million.

### Court Filing Characterizations

**[ECF Doc. 1325-3](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1325-3.pdf) (Giuffre v. Maxwell, Joinder Motion, December 30, 2014):**

Court filings in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case described the relationship between MC2's founder and Epstein:

> "Another person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc Brunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein's closest friends and a regular traveling companion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. visas for many girls."

The filing further alleged:

> "Brunel has been a model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. passports for young girls to 'work' as models. He would bring young girls (ranging to ages as young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein."

### Deposition Fifth Amendment Invocations

**[ECF Doc. 1328-44](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-44.pdf) (Filed 01/05/24):**

Questions regarding Jean-Luc Brunel in depositions were met with Fifth Amendment invocations:

> Q: Each time that Jean Luc Brunel visits Jeffrey Epstein's house, does he bring underage minors to Jeffrey Epstein's house to engage in [sexual activity]?
> A: Fifth.

### Model Housing Arrangements

According to the sworn deposition of former MC2 bookkeeper Maritza Vasquez:

> MC2 housed models in Epstein's Manhattan apartments.

The address 301 East 66th Street, New York was identified in deposition testimony as housing for young models associated with the agency.

### International Recruitment Operations

**Maritza Vasquez Deposition (2010):**

The former bookkeeper testified regarding international recruitment:

> Brunel employed scouts in South America, Europe, and the former Soviet Union to find models to bring to the United States.

### Major Retail Clients

According to Bloomberg reporting (August 2019), MC2's retail clients included:

- Nordstrom (last worked with MC2 in January 2017)
- Macy's Inc.
- Saks Fifth Avenue
- Neiman Marcus
- JCPenney Co.
- Kohl's Corporation
- Target Corporation
- Sears
- Belk

### Client Concerns (2014)

According to published accounts, by 2014 Brunel's business partner Jeff Fuller received a "tremendous amount of worries from our clients" about ties to Epstein, indicating that the relationship was affecting the agency's reputation.

### Civil Lawsuit Allegations

According to complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida:

> "Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, and others deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money."

Virginia Giuffre alleged in a 2014 court filing that the system was a cover for sex trafficking.

### Corporate Dissolution and Asset Sales

Following Epstein's death in August 2019:
- **2017:** MC2 entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with The Identity Models, Inc.
- **September 27, 2019:** MC2 officially dissolved
- **Fall 2019:** MC2 Miami's assets were sold to The Source Models, run by MC2 executives Jeff Fuller and Petra Pedraza

### Agency Name Etymology

According to published accounts, the agency name "MC2" is a reference to Einstein's equation E=mc², with the "E" representing Epstein—a symbolic branding of his ownership stake.

### French Investigation of Founder

- **September 2019:** Paris home and offices of Karin Models (Brunel's predecessor agency) were searched by French investigators
- **December 16, 2020:** Jean-Luc Brunel arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport
- **Charges:** Rape, sexual assault, criminal conspiracy, and human trafficking involving minors
- **February 19, 2022:** Brunel found hanged in his cell at La Sante prison; French authorities ruled his death a suicide

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the business structure:** We view the documented structure of MC2—a legitimate modeling agency with major retail clients, funded by and allegedly connected to Jeffrey Epstein—as representing a concerning pattern. In our assessment, the combination of legitimate business operations with the allegations contained in court filings raises questions about how exploitation may occur within ostensibly legitimate business frameworks.

**Regarding the financial relationship:** The sworn testimony that Epstein invested $1-2 million in MC2, combined with the symbolic naming convention ("E" for Epstein), suggests to us a relationship that went beyond arms-length business dealings. However, we note that financial investment alone does not establish criminal conduct by the agency itself.

**Regarding the model housing arrangements:** The testimony that MC2 housed models in Epstein-controlled apartments in Manhattan represents, in our view, a structural arrangement that warrants scrutiny. Housing young models in properties controlled by someone subsequently convicted of sex offenses creates concerning proximity, though housing arrangements alone do not establish wrongdoing.

**Regarding the international recruitment:** The documented international recruitment network—with scouts in South America, Europe, and the former Soviet Union—mirrors patterns described in court filings alleging trafficking. We observe this structural similarity while acknowledging that international recruitment is standard in the modeling industry.

**Regarding the timing of dissolution:** MC2's dissolution in September 2019, approximately two months after Epstein's arrest and one month after his death, appears to us to be connected to the scrutiny surrounding the Epstein case. The sale of assets to successor agencies run by former MC2 executives suggests business continuity rather than closure.

**Regarding the allegations:** The court filings contain serious allegations that MC2 was used in connection with trafficking activities. These remain allegations that were never adjudicated against MC2 as an entity. Brunel's death before trial means the allegations against him were also never tested in court.

**Our editorial judgment:** MC2 Model Management represents what appears to be a legitimate business operation with documented financial ties to Jeffrey Epstein and a founder who faced serious criminal charges before his death. The intersection of fashion industry legitimacy with the allegations contained in court filings makes this a case study in how exploitation may potentially occur within legitimate business structures. However, MC2 as an entity was never charged with crimes, and the allegations against its founder were never adjudicated.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing the same documentary record might conclude:

1. **Legitimate business operations:** MC2 was a functioning modeling agency with major retail clients. Its business operations may have been entirely legitimate, separate from any personal conduct by its founder or investors.

2. **Standard industry practices:** International recruitment networks, model housing arrangements, and investor relationships are common in the modeling industry. These practices do not inherently indicate wrongdoing.

3. **Civil allegations, not convictions:** The allegations in court filings represent claims by plaintiffs, not adjudicated facts. MC2 as an entity was never criminally charged. Civil litigation filings present one side's characterization.

4. **Founder not convicted:** Jean-Luc Brunel died before trial. The presumption of innocence applies, and the charges against him were never proven in court.

5. **Third-party investor:** Epstein's investment in MC2 does not necessarily mean the agency was complicit in any of his documented crimes. Investors in many businesses have engaged in criminal conduct unrelated to those investments.

6. **Timing of dissolution:** The agency's dissolution following Epstein's arrest may reflect business necessity (loss of clients, reputational damage) rather than any admission of wrongdoing.

7. **Successor operations:** The sale of MC2's assets to other modeling agencies run by former MC2 executives suggests the business model itself was viewed as legitimate and continuing.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
