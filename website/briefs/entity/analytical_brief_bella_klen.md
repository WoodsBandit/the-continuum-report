## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in documents reflects potential involvement in proceedings, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Klen.** She appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is limited.** Three mentions do not provide extensive detail about her role.

- **Her role may be procedural.** References in deposition documents often relate to court reporting or administrative functions.

- **Discovery identification is routine.** Both sides in litigation identify persons involved in proceedings.

- **The specific relationship to the case is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
