## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Alfredo Rodriguez was a household employee at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach mansion whose deposition testimony provided key evidence regarding activities at the property. Rodriguez's testimony is cited in multiple court filings as corroborating witness statements regarding Ghislaine Maxwell's knowledge of events at Epstein's residence.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Alfredo Rodriguez served as a butler/household manager at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach mansion. Based on our review, he provided deposition testimony in 2009 that is cited extensively in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation. Court filings indicate that Rodriguez testified to Maxwell's knowledge of young women visiting the Epstein residence and to threatening communications from Maxwell. Rodriguez was convicted in 2010 of obstruction of justice related to attempting to sell Epstein's address book (the so-called "black book") rather than turning it over to authorities. He died in December 2014. His testimony, provided under oath before his death, remains part of the documentary record in the civil litigation.

> "Q. Okay. Going back to where we started here was, does Ghislaine Maxwell have knowledge of the girls that would come over to Jeffrey Epstein's house that are in roughly the same age group as C. and T. (minor children) and to have a good time as you put it?
> A. Yes.
> Q. And what was her involvement and/or knowledge about that?
> A. She knew what was going on."

### Alleged Threatening Communication from Maxwell

**[ECF Doc. 1320-6](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-6.pdf), filed 01/03/24, p. 7** (quoting Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 169-172):

> "Mrs. Maxwell called me and told me not to ever discuss or contact her again in a threaten(ing) way... She said I forbid you that you're going to be – that I will be sorry if I contact any of her friends again... She said something like don't open your mouth or something like that."

### Testimony Regarding Prior Statements to Police

**[ECF Doc. 1331-11](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-11.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Rodriguez testified that when he previously told police officers that girls appeared to be 18 years or older, he did so because he "was fearful of reprise from Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein."

### Obstruction of Justice Conviction

Alfredo Rodriguez was convicted in 2010 of obstruction of justice for attempting to sell Jeffrey Epstein's address book (containing names and contact information of associates) rather than surrendering it to federal authorities as required. He was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. Rodriguez died in December 2014.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Rodriguez's testimony:** In our assessment, Rodriguez's deposition testimony provides specific, direct statements regarding Ghislaine Maxwell's knowledge of activities at the Epstein residence. His testimony that Maxwell "knew what was going on" regarding young women visiting the property appears unequivocal.

**Regarding the threatening communication:** Rodriguez testified to receiving what he characterized as threatening communications from Maxwell warning him not to speak. We interpret this testimony as relevant to understanding the dynamics between household staff and Epstein/Maxwell, though we note this is Rodriguez's account of events.

**Regarding his recantation of prior statements:** Rodriguez testified that he told police girls appeared to be 18 or older because he feared reprisal from Epstein and Maxwell. This suggests, in our view, that his initial statements to police may not have reflected his actual observations.

**Regarding his obstruction conviction:** Rodriguez's 2010 conviction for attempting to sell Epstein's address book raises questions about his credibility and motives. We observe that the conviction involved attempting to profit from evidence rather than witness cooperation. However, his deposition testimony was provided under oath and is cited in court filings as relevant evidence.

**Regarding his death:** Rodriguez died in December 2014, before the Giuffre v. Maxwell case proceeded and before Epstein's 2019 arrest and Maxwell's 2020 arrest. His testimony therefore could not be subjected to cross-examination in subsequent proceedings.

**Our editorial judgment:** Rodriguez's testimony provides one of several insider accounts of activities at Epstein's Palm Beach residence. His obstruction conviction and death complicate assessment of his credibility, but his sworn deposition statements remain part of the documentary record and were cited as evidence in civil litigation.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **The obstruction conviction undermines credibility.** Rodriguez's conviction for attempting to sell evidence rather than cooperate with authorities raises significant questions about his motives and truthfulness. His testimony may have been self-serving or designed to curry favor with prosecutors.

2. **Fear of reprisal claims are unverifiable.** Rodriguez's assertion that he lied to police because he feared Epstein and Maxwell cannot be independently verified. He may have made false statements for other reasons and later offered this explanation to explain inconsistencies.

3. **The "threatening" communication may be exaggerated.** Rodriguez characterized a communication from Maxwell as threatening, but the quoted language ("don't open your mouth") could reflect concern about publicity or litigation rather than criminal intimidation.

4. **Testimony provided before death could not be tested.** Because Rodriguez died before subsequent proceedings, his testimony was never subjected to the rigorous cross-examination of a trial. Defense attorneys did not have full opportunity to challenge his account.

5. **Employee observations may be limited.** As a household employee, Rodriguez's observations were necessarily limited to what he witnessed in his role. He may not have had complete information about relationships or activities.

6. **The testimony was provided in civil, not criminal, context.** Deposition testimony in civil litigation occurs under different circumstances than criminal trial testimony, with different standards and procedures.

7. **Rodriguez had potential civil litigation exposure.** As an employee at the residence where alleged crimes occurred, Rodriguez may have had personal reasons to distance himself from responsibility and direct blame toward Maxwell.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
