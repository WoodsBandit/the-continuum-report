## Statement of Public Interest

The Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004 represents Congress's effort to codify enforceable rights for victims of federal crimes within the criminal justice system. The statute gained national prominence through litigation arising from the 2008 Jeffrey Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA), where victims alleged federal prosecutors violated their statutory rights by negotiating and finalizing the agreement in secret. Judge Kenneth Marra's 2019 ruling that the government violated the CVRA, combined with the Eleventh Circuit's subsequent en banc decision limiting judicial enforcement of pre-charge rights, established significant precedent regarding the scope and limitations of victim participation in federal criminal proceedings.

This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse on the balance between prosecutorial discretion and victims' rights in the federal criminal justice system.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The Crime Victims' Rights Act (18 U.S.C. Section 3771) codifies a series of rights for victims of federal crimes, including the right to confer with prosecutors and to be treated with fairness. In our assessment, the Epstein CVRA litigation exposed a significant gap between the statute's promise and its enforcement mechanisms. Judge Marra's February 2019 ruling found clear CVRA violations—prosecutors concealed the NPA from victims and "affirmatively misled" them—yet the Eleventh Circuit ultimately held that victims could not obtain meaningful judicial relief because no formal charges had been filed against Epstein. We interpret the case as demonstrating both the importance of the CVRA framework and its limitations when applied to pre-charge prosecutorial decisions.

The Crime Victims' Rights Act grants crime victims the following rights:

> "(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.
> (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused.

**Source:** [18 U.S.C. Section 3771](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3771), Legal Information Institute

The statute defines "crime victim" as:

> "a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia."

### The Jane Doe Litigation (2008-2019)

**Case:** *Jane Doe #1 and #2 v. United States*, No. 08-cv-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla.)

**[ECF Doc. 1330-1](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1330-1.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24:

On July 7, 2008, Attorney Bradley J. Edwards filed an emergency petition alleging:

> "the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida had concealed from Epstein's victims a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) that they had reached with Epstein."

### Judge Marra's February 2019 Ruling

U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra issued a 33-page ruling finding CVRA violations:

> "Under the facts of this case, once the Government failed to advise the victims about its intention to enter into the [plea agreement], a violation of the CVRA occurred."

Regarding prosecutorial conduct, Judge Marra found:

> "While the Government spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's attorneys, scant information was shared with victims. Instead, the victims were told to be 'patient' while the investigation proceeded."

The Court found that prosecutors "misled victims to 'believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.'"

### September 2019 Remedies Ruling

In a subsequent ruling, Judge Marra denied monetary relief but acknowledged the case's impact:

> "Despite Petitioners having demonstrated the Government violated their rights under the CVRA, in the end they are not receiving much, if any, of the relief they sought."

The Court stated:

> "The CVRA does not authorize an award of restitution against the United States."

However, Judge Marra noted:

> "[Victims] may take solace, however, in the fact that this litigation has brought national attention to the Crime Victims' Rights Act and the importance of victims in the criminal justice system... [and resulted in] the United States Department of Justice acknowledging its shortcomings in dealing with crime victims, and its promise to better train its prosecutors regarding the rights of victims under the CVRA in the future."

### The 11th Circuit En Banc Decision: *In re: Courtney Wild*

**Case:** *In re: Courtney Wild*, No. 19-13843 (11th Cir. 2021)

The Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, addressed two questions:

> "(1) Whether the CVRA creates rights that attach and apply before the formal commencement of criminal proceedings; and (2) Whether, even assuming that it does so, the CVRA further creates a private right of action, such that any pre-charge right is judicially enforceable."

The majority ruled against Wild:

> "We have the profoundest sympathy for Ms. Wild and others like her, who suffered unspeakable horror at Epstein's hands, only to be left in the dark—and, so it seems, affirmatively misled—by government attorneys. Even so, we find ourselves constrained to deny Ms. Wild's petition."

The Court held that since no formal charges were ever filed against Epstein, Wild could not seek judicial enforcement of CVRA rights:

> "Since the government never filed charges against Epstein, there was no preexisting proceeding in which Wild could have moved for relief under the CVRA."

**Dissent** by Judge Hull, joined by Judges Martin and Pryor:

> "The majority's ruling—limiting judicial enforcement of CVRA violations to a formal post-charge period—leaves federal prosecutors free to engage in the secret plea deals and deception pre-charge that resulted in the travesty here."

### Connection to Giuffre v. Maxwell Proceedings

**[ECF Doc. 1325-3](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1325-3.pdf)**, filed 01/04/24:

Attorneys Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell filed a motion for Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 to join the CVRA action. Virginia Giuffre participated in the Florida case as "Jane Doe #3" before becoming the named plaintiff in *Giuffre v. Maxwell*.

The motion described Jane Doe #4 as:

> "an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-old child" who was told "she could make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach" in or around summer 2002.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the CVRA's purpose:** In our assessment, the Crime Victims' Rights Act represents an important congressional effort to give crime victims a meaningful role in federal criminal proceedings. The statute recognizes that victims have legitimate interests in how their cases are handled, particularly regarding the right to confer with prosecutors about plea negotiations.

**Regarding the Epstein case as a test of the statute:** We view the Epstein CVRA litigation as exposing a fundamental tension in the statute's design. Judge Marra unambiguously found that prosecutors violated the law—they negotiated in secret, concealed the NPA, and misled victims. Yet despite these findings, the judicial system could not void the agreement or provide meaningful remedies.

**Regarding the Eleventh Circuit's ruling:** In our interpretation, the en banc decision creates a significant loophole. By limiting CVRA enforcement to post-charge proceedings, the court effectively exempts from judicial review precisely the type of pre-charge prosecutorial misconduct that occurred in the Epstein case. Wealthy defendants who can negotiate non-prosecution agreements before formal charges may avoid CVRA requirements entirely.

**Regarding prosecutorial discretion:** We note that the statute explicitly preserves prosecutorial discretion and bars damages claims against the government. These limitations appear designed to balance victim participation against traditional executive branch authority over criminal prosecution. Whether this balance is appropriate is a question of legislative policy.

**Regarding the NPA process:** The documentary record suggests that the Non-Prosecution Agreement was negotiated extensively with Epstein's high-powered legal team—including Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz—while victims were given minimal information. We interpret this as demonstrating how resource disparities between defendants and victims can undermine the CVRA's protective intent.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Epstein CVRA litigation revealed both the promise and limitations of federal victims' rights law. While the statute codifies important rights, its enforcement mechanisms proved inadequate when prosecutors violated those rights before filing formal charges. The case demonstrates that statutory rights require robust enforcement mechanisms to be meaningful.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing the same record might conclude:

1. **Prosecutorial discretion is constitutionally grounded.** The Executive Branch's authority over prosecution decisions predates and may supersede statutory victim participation rights. Limiting judicial review of pre-charge decisions respects separation of powers principles.

2. **The Eleventh Circuit interpreted the statute correctly.** The CVRA's text contemplates "court proceedings" and formal case processes. Extending the statute to pre-charge decisions would require judicial supervision of investigative and prosecutorial choices that have traditionally been unreviewable.

3. **The 2019 federal prosecution represented accountability.** Although the original NPA was not voided, Epstein was subsequently indicted by SDNY in 2019. The CVRA litigation may have contributed to this renewed prosecution by generating public pressure and revealing the original agreement's terms.

4. **Legislative reform is the appropriate remedy.** If the CVRA's enforcement mechanisms are inadequate, Congress can amend the statute. The "Courtney Wild Reinforcing Crime Victims' Rights Act" introduced in Congress reflects ongoing legislative efforts to strengthen victim protections.

5. **The DOJ acknowledged its failures.** As Judge Marra noted, the litigation resulted in DOJ "acknowledging its shortcomings" and promising better prosecutor training. Institutional reform, rather than judicial voiding of the NPA, may represent a more systemic remedy.

6. **The case involved unique circumstances.** Epstein's wealth, connections, and legal resources created a power imbalance that may not characterize typical federal prosecutions. The case may represent an outlier rather than a systemic failure of the CVRA framework.

7. **Victim participation must be balanced against other interests.** Prosecutors may have legitimate reasons for not fully disclosing negotiation details—including protecting ongoing investigations, avoiding witness intimidation, or preserving prosecutorial flexibility. The CVRA's limitations may reflect intentional legislative choices about these trade-offs.
