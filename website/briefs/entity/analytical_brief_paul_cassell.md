## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Paul G. Cassell is a law professor and prominent victims' rights advocate who represented Jane Doe victims in Crime Victims' Rights Act litigation against the U.S. government regarding the 2008 Epstein non-prosecution agreement. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Paul G. Cassell is a law professor at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah and a nationally recognized authority on victims' rights law. In the Epstein-related matters, Cassell served as co-counsel with attorney Bradley J. Edwards representing victims in Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) litigation against the United States government. Cassell and Edwards argued that the government violated the CVRA by secretly negotiating and finalizing a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein without notifying identified victims. In our assessment, Cassell played a central role in bringing public scrutiny to the controversial 2008 plea arrangement. He also briefly faced defamation claims by Alan Dershowitz, which were resolved through a joint settlement statement in 2016. Cassell has never been accused of any wrongdoing; his role in these matters has been as a legal advocate for victims.

## The Public Record

### Role as Victims' Rights Counsel

**[ECF Doc. 1330-1](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1330-1.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Declaration of Paul G. Cassell):

Professor Cassell provided a declaration in the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation explaining the CVRA case and the 2008 non-prosecution agreement.

According to court filings referencing Cassell's work, on July 7, 2008, attorney Bradley J. Edwards filed an emergency petition to enforce the rights of "Jane Doe No. 1" and "Jane Doe No. 2" under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771. Cassell later joined Edwards as co-counsel.

**[ECF Doc. 1325-3](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1325-3.pdf), filed 01/04/24** (Jane Doe #3 and #4 Motion for Joinder):

On December 30, 2014, attorneys Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell filed a motion for Jane Doe #3 (Virginia Giuffre) and Jane Doe #4 to join the CVRA action.

### Motion Contents

**[ECF Doc. 1320-9](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-9.pdf), filed 01/03/24**:

The motion filed by Edwards and Cassell included detailed allegations regarding Jane Doe #4:

> "an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-old child" who was told "she could make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach" in or around summer 2002.

The motion alleged Epstein:

> "asking her personally to come to his mansion in Palm Beach."

During her first visit:

> "Epstein asked Jane Doe #[4] her age and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed illegal sexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions."

### Dershowitz Defamation Dispute

**[ECF Doc. 1330-2](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1330-2.pdf), filed 01/05/24**:

Alan Dershowitz sued Virginia Giuffre's attorneys, including Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards, for defamation. The parties reached a settlement documented in a "Joint Statement of Brad Edwards, Paul Cassell and Alan Dershowitz (Apr. 8, 2016)" resolving "All Proceedings Against Professor Dershowitz."

Court filings indicate the joint statement acknowledged the claims against the attorneys were resolved.

### Professional Background

Based on public court filings, Cassell's professional positions include:
- Distinguished Professor of Law, S.J. Quinney College of Law, University of Utah
- Former federal judge (U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, 2002-2007)
- Author of scholarly work on victims' rights and the Crime Victims' Rights Act

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Cassell's role in CVRA litigation:** In our assessment, Professor Cassell's involvement in the CVRA case brought significant legal expertise to the victims' fight for recognition under federal law. The litigation he co-led with Edwards established important precedent regarding victims' rights during criminal investigations and helped expose the secret non-prosecution agreement.

**Regarding the joinder motion:** The December 2014 motion seeking to add Jane Doe #3 (Virginia Giuffre) and Jane Doe #4 to the CVRA litigation included detailed, specific allegations about Epstein's conduct. We observe that while the motion was ultimately denied, its filing brought these allegations into the public record.

**Regarding the Dershowitz settlement:** The 2016 settlement with Dershowitz resolved the defamation claims without a determination on the merits. We note that such settlements are common in complex litigation and should not be interpreted as admissions by either party.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record shows Professor Cassell serving in a traditional legal advocacy role on behalf of crime victims. His work contributed to public understanding of the 2008 plea arrangement and helped establish precedent for victims' rights enforcement. There is no indication in the court records of any impropriety in his conduct.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Cassell's role was purely professional.** He appeared in these cases as legal counsel, not as a witness or party to underlying events. His appearance in court records reflects his professional work, not personal involvement.

- **The CVRA litigation, while unsuccessful in preventing the plea agreement, created important precedent.** The court's rulings on victims' standing expanded understanding of the CVRA's scope.

- **The Dershowitz settlement was a mutual resolution** that allowed all parties to move forward without establishing fault on any side.

- **The joinder motion's denial** does not reflect on the quality of legal work; courts deny procedural motions for many reasons unrelated to the merits.

- **Cassell's federal judicial experience** and academic credentials suggest his involvement reflected genuine expertise in victims' rights law rather than any other motivation.

- **The public record contains no allegations against Cassell.** He appears in documents solely as an attorney advocating for clients.

- **The detailed allegations in the joinder motion** were made on behalf of clients and attributed to those clients; Cassell presented them in his capacity as counsel.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
