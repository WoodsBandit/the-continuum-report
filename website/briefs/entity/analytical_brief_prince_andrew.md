## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Prince Andrew, Duke of York, is a member of the British Royal Family who became a central figure in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal through allegations made by Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre alleged she was trafficked to Prince Andrew for sexual purposes when she was 17 years old. Prince Andrew repeatedly denied all allegations. In August 2021, Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew; the case was settled in February 2022 for undisclosed terms without admission of liability. Prince Andrew was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages. No criminal charges have been filed against him.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations from court documents without editorial comment.*

### Discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell

**[ECF Doc. 1327-12](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Maxwell's First Request for Production responses stated that Giuffre's requests "sought, inter alia: all communications with thirteen specific witnesses, namely Jeffrey Epstein, Virginia Roberts, Prince Andrew, Ross Gow, Alan Dershowitz, Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Glenn and Eva Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcincova and Bill and Hillary Clinton."

**[ECF Doc. 1327-14](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-14.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Maxwell's attorney Laura Menninger distinguished Prince Andrew from hundreds of other proposed witness names, noting he was among a limited group "for whom Giuffre had specifically requested all communications."

### Nature of Giuffre's Allegations

According to pleadings in various proceedings, Giuffre alleged:

- She was approximately 17 years old when directed to engage in sexual acts with Prince Andrew
- The encounters occurred at multiple locations including Maxwell's London residence, Epstein's New York mansion, and Epstein's private island
- She was coerced and trafficked for these purposes by Epstein and Maxwell
- Maxwell personally orchestrated and facilitated these encounters

### The Photograph

A widely circulated photograph shows Prince Andrew with his arm around Virginia Giuffre's waist, with Ghislaine Maxwell visible in the background. The photograph purportedly was taken at Maxwell's London residence in 2001, when Giuffre was 17 years old.

In his November 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew questioned whether the photograph was genuine and claimed he had "no recollection" of meeting Virginia Giuffre.

Photographic experts who examined the image found no evidence of manipulation.

### Civil Lawsuit and Settlement

**Giuffre v. Prince Andrew (2021-2022):**

On August 9, 2021, Virginia Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress under the New York Child Victims Act.

On January 12, 2022, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan denied Prince Andrew's motion to dismiss, ruling that the case could proceed to discovery.

On February 15, 2022, the parties announced an out-of-court settlement. According to the joint filing:

- Prince Andrew agreed to make a "substantial donation" to Giuffre's charity
- Prince Andrew acknowledged that Giuffre "suffered as an established victim of abuse and trafficking"
- Prince Andrew expressed "regret for his association with Epstein"
- The settlement contained no admission of liability

### Consequences

Following the allegations and litigation:

- Prince Andrew was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages
- He can no longer use the style "His Royal Highness" in official capacities
- He has been effectively removed from public royal duties

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the allegations:** Giuffre made specific and detailed allegations against Prince Andrew that remained consistent over many years. The allegations describe conduct with a 17-year-old, which would constitute criminal conduct under U.S. law. Prince Andrew denied all allegations.

**Regarding the photograph:** The photograph showing Prince Andrew with his arm around Giuffre, with Maxwell present, has been examined by experts who found no evidence of manipulation. Prince Andrew's questioning of the photograph's authenticity in his BBC interview was not supported by expert analysis.

**Regarding the settlement:** The February 2022 settlement came immediately after Judge Kaplan denied Prince Andrew's motion to dismiss, meaning the case was about to proceed to discovery. In our view, the timing may suggest the prospect of discovery—including potential depositions—could have influenced the decision to settle. However, settlements occur for many reasons, and the terms included no admission of liability.

**Regarding Prince Andrew's acknowledgment:** The settlement included Prince Andrew's acknowledgment that Giuffre "suffered as an established victim of abuse and trafficking" and his expression of "regret" for his association with Epstein. We interpret this language as significant, though it falls short of admitting personal wrongdoing.

**Regarding the absence of trial:** Because the case settled before discovery, the allegations were never tested through the adversarial process. No evidence was subjected to cross-examination, and no finder of fact made determinations about credibility or liability.

**Our editorial judgment:** The public record contains serious and specific allegations by Giuffre, categorical denials by Prince Andrew, and a settlement that resolved the legal claims without establishing the truth or falsity of the underlying facts. The consequences for Prince Andrew—loss of titles, patronages, and public role—have been severe regardless of the legal outcome.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **The settlement does not establish wrongdoing.** Prince Andrew may have settled to avoid the cost, distraction, and reputational harm of continued litigation rather than because the allegations were true.

- **The denial of the motion to dismiss was a procedural ruling**, not a finding on the merits. It meant only that the case could proceed, not that the allegations were proven.

- **Prince Andrew's acknowledgment of Giuffre as a "victim"** referred to her status as a victim of Epstein and Maxwell generally, not an admission that he personally harmed her.

- **The absence of other accusers** distinguishes Prince Andrew's situation from others in the Epstein network against whom multiple individuals have made allegations.

- **The photograph establishes proximity** but does not, by itself, establish the conduct Giuffre alleged.

- **The settlement preserved privacy** for both parties and may have reflected mutual interest in finality rather than an assessment of liability.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of approximately 28 documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation.

**What we did not review:**
- Filings from Giuffre v. Prince Andrew (the direct lawsuit)
- Complete discovery from either case (settled before completion)
- Prince Andrew's own statements beyond public sources
- Evidence that would have been produced had the case proceeded

**Critical limitation:** The settlement of Giuffre v. Prince Andrew before discovery means the allegations were never tested in court. The historical record remains incomplete, and fundamental factual questions are unresolved.
