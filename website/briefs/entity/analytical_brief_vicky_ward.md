## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Ward's journalistic role:** In our assessment, Vicky Ward was among the earliest journalists to profile Jeffrey Epstein in a major publication. Her 2003 *Vanity Fair* article came years before Epstein's first criminal investigation in Palm Beach.

**Regarding editorial decisions:** Ward has publicly stated that allegations from young women were removed from her 2003 article by *Vanity Fair* editors. We observe that the circumstances surrounding these editorial decisions became a subject of public discussion after Epstein's arrest.

**Regarding her inclusion in discovery:** Ward's identification in Maxwell's Rule 26 disclosures reflects that both parties considered her a person with knowledge relevant to the litigation. This is consistent with her role as a journalist who covered Epstein.

**Our editorial judgment:** Vicky Ward appears in the documentary record as a journalist whose early coverage of Jeffrey Epstein became relevant to subsequent litigation. Her public statements about editorial decisions regarding her 2003 article raise questions about what was known about Epstein and when, though the documentary record in this litigation does not address those questions directly.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Ward performed standard journalistic work.** Her presence in documents reflects routine identification of persons with relevant knowledge in litigation.

- **Editorial decisions were made by editors, not Ward.** If allegations were removed from her article, that decision would have been made by *Vanity Fair* editors, not Ward herself.

- **Early journalism faced different information landscape.** In 2003, the scope of allegations against Epstein was not as documented as it became after the Palm Beach investigation.

- **Journalists routinely appear in litigation discovery.** Reporters who cover subjects of litigation are frequently identified as persons with relevant knowledge.

- **Ward subsequently reported extensively on Epstein.** Her later journalism has covered the Epstein case, suggesting continued engagement with the story.

- **The documentary record is limited regarding Ward.** The court documents do not provide extensive detail about Ward's knowledge or her interactions with Epstein or Maxwell.

- **No allegations exist against Ward.** She appears in documents solely in her capacity as a journalist.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
