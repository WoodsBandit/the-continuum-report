## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Gergen was mentioned incidentally.** Prominent political figures often appear in litigation involving high-profile individuals.

- **Public figures frequently appear in high-profile cases.** Such mentions do not indicate involvement.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in documents reflects mention, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Gergen.** The reference appears incidental rather than substantive.

- **The documentary record is very limited.** One mention provides minimal context.

- **Many prominent names appear in complex litigation.** Such mentions are routine in comprehensive discovery.

- **The connection to the case appears tangential.** A single mention suggests no significant involvement.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
