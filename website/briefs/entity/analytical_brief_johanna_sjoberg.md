### Deposition Testimony

**ECF Doc. 1327-23 (Filed 01/05/24):**

Johanna Sjoberg provided deposition testimony in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case on May 18, 2016. Her testimony addressed:
- Circumstances of her initial contact with the Epstein operation
- Her experiences at Epstein's properties
- Observations of other individuals and activities
- The role of Ghislaine Maxwell in recruitment

### Recruitment Account

According to testimony and published accounts, Sjoberg was approached while a college student with what appeared to be a legitimate job opportunity. This recruitment method—using the appearance of legitimate employment—is consistent with accounts from other alleged victims.

### Role as Witness

Sjoberg's testimony contributed to the documentary record establishing:
- Methods of recruitment used by the operation
- Activities at Epstein's properties
- The role of Maxwell in the operation
- Corroboration of other witness accounts

### Litigation Significance

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the recruitment method:** Sjoberg's account of being recruited through an apparent job opportunity illustrates a documented pattern. Targeting college students with employment offers creates an appearance of legitimacy that victims have described as disarming. This method appears throughout victim accounts.

**Regarding testimony corroboration:** In our assessment, Sjoberg's testimony gains significance from its consistency with other victim accounts. When multiple independent witnesses describe similar methods, experiences, and individuals, the collective testimony carries more weight than any single account.

**Regarding her victim status:** Sjoberg is identified as a victim in court records. Her willingness to provide testimony despite the personal difficulty this entails contributed to the documentary record that supported Maxwell's prosecution.

**Our editorial judgment:** Johanna Sjoberg's testimony represents valuable first-hand documentation of the Epstein operation's recruitment methods and activities. Her account contributes to understanding how the operation functioned and how victims were targeted.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Civil litigation context:** Deposition testimony was given in civil litigation where financial interests may influence accounts.

- **Memory and retrospection:** Events described occurred years before testimony was given; memory can be affected by time and subsequent information.

- **Corroboration complexity:** While multiple accounts sharing elements can indicate truth, it can also reflect information sharing between witnesses or media influence.

- **Limited documentation:** The public record contains excerpts rather than complete testimony, limiting full evaluation.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
