A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Kahn served in a professional capacity.** Estate executors perform legal and fiduciary duties; this does not imply personal knowledge of or involvement in the decedent's conduct.

- **Estate administration is a legal function.** Managing an estate involves assets, liabilities, and claims—not endorsement of the decedent's actions.

- **The victims' fund was a significant undertaking.** The compensation program distributed substantial funds to victims, requiring professional administration.

- **No allegations exist against Kahn.** He appears in documents in connection with estate duties, not as an accused party.

- **Co-executor roles involve shared responsibility.** Kahn and Indyke would have shared duties in managing estate matters.

- **Professional roles require court oversight.** Estate administration occurs under court supervision.

- **The documentary record is limited.** References to Kahn do not provide extensive detail about his activities.
