## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Eva Dubin is a physician and former Miss Sweden (1980) who is married to hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin. Her name appears in documents unsealed from the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation in the context of discovery requests and social connections. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Eva Dubin (née Andersson) is a physician who appears in the Giuffre v. Maxwell documentary record primarily as the wife of Glenn Dubin and as a friend of Ghislaine Maxwell. Based on our review, Eva Dubin was named alongside her husband in discovery requests seeking communications with thirteen specific individuals. Maxwell testified in deposition that Eva Dubin was her friend. The documentary record contains no allegations of wrongdoing against Eva Dubin herself. In our assessment, Eva Dubin appears in these documents as a social acquaintance of Maxwell and Epstein's network, without any suggestion of participation in or knowledge of illegal activity.

**[ECF Doc. 1327-12](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24**:

The First Request for Production responses stated that plaintiff's requests:

> "sought, inter alia: all communications with thirteen specific witnesses, namely Jeffrey Epstein, Virginia Roberts, Prince Andrew, Ross Gow, Alan Dershowitz, Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Glenn and Eva Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcincova and Bill and Hillary Clinton."

Eva Dubin appears on the list of thirteen specific witnesses for whom Giuffre requested all of Maxwell's communications.

### Maxwell's Testimony Regarding Friendship

**[ECF Doc. 1327-21](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-21.pdf), filed 01/05/24, pp. 269-270** (Maxwell Deposition):

When asked about her relationship with Glenn Dubin, Maxwell responded:

> "Q. Is Eva Dubin one of your friends?
> A. Yes."

Maxwell acknowledged that Eva Dubin was her friend and that she knew Glenn Dubin as "the husband of Eva Dubin."

### Absence of Allegations

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Eva Dubin's documentary presence:** In our assessment, Eva Dubin's appearance in these documents reflects her social connection to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell identified Eva Dubin as her friend. This friendship placed Eva Dubin within the social circles that became the subject of litigation, but does not establish any involvement in alleged illegal activity.

**Regarding the discovery requests:** The inclusion of "Glenn and Eva Dubin" in the list of thirteen specific witnesses reflects the plaintiff's interest in communications with Epstein's social network. Being named in a discovery request establishes that a party sought information, not that the person named engaged in misconduct.

**Regarding the nature of the references:** We find no substantive allegations against Eva Dubin in the documentary record. Her appearances are limited to her identification as Glenn Dubin's wife and Maxwell's friend.

**Regarding absence of allegations:** Unlike some other individuals in the documentary record, no witness made any allegation against Eva Dubin. Her presence in documents appears entirely incidental to her husband's and Maxwell's appearances.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record shows Eva Dubin as a social acquaintance of Ghislaine Maxwell without any associated allegations. Her inclusion in discovery requests reflects the broad scope of litigation discovery, not evidence of wrongdoing.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Eva Dubin appears solely due to social connections.** Her presence in the documentary record reflects friendship with Maxwell and marriage to Glenn Dubin, not any alleged wrongdoing.

- **Being named in discovery requests is not accusatory.** Litigation discovery routinely seeks communications with social acquaintances; this does not imply the acquaintances engaged in misconduct.

- **No allegations exist against Eva Dubin.** Unlike others in the documentary record, no witness accused her of any wrongdoing.

- **Social acquaintance with Maxwell is common in certain circles.** Many prominent New Yorkers knew Maxwell socially without any involvement in or knowledge of illegal activity.

- **Maxwell's identification of Eva as a friend** establishes social connection but nothing more.

- **Eva Dubin has never been charged** with any offense and has not been publicly accused of wrongdoing by any victim or prosecutor.

- **Her professional identity as a physician** is separate from her social connections documented in these materials.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
