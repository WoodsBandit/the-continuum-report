A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Roberts was identified during standard discovery.** Discovery processes identify individuals who may have relevant knowledge.

- **The shared surname suggests family connection.** Virginia Giuffre's maiden name was Roberts.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Roberts.** She appears in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is limited.** Two mentions do not provide extensive detail about her role.

- **Family members often appear in victim-related litigation.** Such identification is routine in discovery.

- **The specific relationship to the case is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
