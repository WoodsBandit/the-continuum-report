## Statement of Public Interest

The United States Virgin Islands occupies a unique position in the Epstein matter as both the location of Jeffrey Epstein's primary residence and private island (Little St. James) and as a jurisdiction that pursued significant civil enforcement actions against his estate and financial enablers. The USVI Attorney General's office brought groundbreaking civil actions under the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Virgin Islands Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (CICO Act), resulting in over $180 million in settlements. These actions established precedent for governmental parens patriae enforcement against financial institutions that facilitate trafficking operations. The documents analyzed herein were filed in federal court and are matters of public record. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse on matters of significant governmental and public interest.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The U.S. Virgin Islands emerges from the documentary record in two distinct roles. First, as a geographic jurisdiction, the USVI was central to Epstein's operations: he was a registered resident, owned two private islands (Little St. James and Great St. James), incorporated numerous business entities there, and received substantial tax benefits through the Virgin Islands Economic Development Commission. Multiple victim accounts describe being transported to the islands and alleging abuse occurred there. Second, as a governmental authority, the USVI pursued what appears to be one of the most significant enforcement actions against Epstein's financial infrastructure. In our assessment, the USVI's complaint against JPMorgan Chase represents a detailed roadmap of how financial institutions allegedly facilitated the trafficking operation through willful blindness to suspicious transactions. The settlements totaling over $180 million from Epstein's estate, JPMorgan Chase, and other parties suggest the USVI established the factual basis for these allegations sufficient to compel substantial resolution.

> "In October 2012, the Southern Trust Company -- one of the companies Epstein owned -- applied for economic benefits from the Virgin Islands Economic Development Commission ('EDC') so the company could provide 'cutting edge consulting services' in the area of 'biomedical and financial informatics.' Southern Trust Company received a 10-year package of economic incentives running from February 1, 2013 until January 31, 2023 that included a 90% exemption from income taxes and 100% exemptions from gross receipts, excise, and withholding taxes in the Virgin Islands."

> "JP Morgan knowingly facilitated, sustained, and concealed the human trafficking network operated by Jeffrey Epstein from his home and base in the Virgin Islands, and financially benefitted from this participation, directly or indirectly, by failing to comply with federal banking regulations."

**[USVI v. JPMorgan Complaint](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/financial-enablers/2022-USVI-V-JPMORGAN-COMPLAINT-EPSTEIN-TRAFFICKING.pdf), filed 12/27/22, p. 3, para. 6:**

Epstein created a network of companies and individuals who participated in, directly or indirectly, and conspired with him in a pattern of criminal activity related to the sex trafficking, forced labor, sexual assault, child abuse, and sexual servitude of these young women and children... Epstein and his associates trafficked underage girls to the Virgin Islands, held them captive, and sexually abused them, causing them grave physical, mental, and emotional injury."

> "Many of these women, particularly after Epstein's conviction in 2008, were trafficked from Eastern Europe. As the Government explained in its Second Amended Complaint, these women were recruited and, in several instances, required to marry other Epstein victims in order to maintain their immigration status and their availability to Epstein."

### USVI Governmental Actions

After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction... As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, Nadia Macinkova, and various other girls and guests he brought to the island."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding USVI as an enabler jurisdiction:** In our assessment, the documentary record presents a troubling picture of how USVI's tax incentive programs were allegedly exploited. The Southern Trust Company received significant tax exemptions ostensibly for "biomedical and financial informatics" services that, according to the USVI's own complaint, "appeared to perform no informatics or data-mining services" but instead "funded the Epstein Enterprise." This raises questions about the adequacy of oversight mechanisms for economic development incentives.

**Regarding USVI as enforcement authority:** We view the USVI's civil enforcement actions as among the most significant governmental responses to the Epstein matter. The parens patriae approach -- suing on behalf of residents and visitors -- represents an innovative legal strategy that produced substantial settlements. The JPMorgan complaint in particular provides detailed allegations about how financial institutions allegedly facilitated trafficking through willful blindness.

**Regarding the settlements:** The combined settlements exceeding $180 million (Epstein estate: $105M+; JPMorgan: $75M) suggest the USVI established a credible factual basis for its allegations. While settlements do not constitute admissions of liability, the magnitude of these payments indicates defendants assessed significant litigation risk.

**Regarding victim allegations in USVI:** Multiple sworn statements describe the Virgin Islands -- particularly Little St. James Island -- as a location where alleged abuse occurred. Sarah Ransome's affidavit describes multiple visits to the island and observations of young women who "appeared to be young teenagers." The geographic isolation of a private island would have provided apparent privacy for activities that were allegedly criminal.

**Regarding the tax incentive issue:** The complaint's allegations about Southern Trust Company obtaining 90% income tax exemptions and 100% exemptions from other taxes while allegedly serving as "a conduit for payment to foreign women, credit cards, airplanes and other instrumentalities" of the trafficking operation raises broader questions about how Epstein exploited institutional structures.

**Our editorial judgment:** The USVI's role in the Epstein matter reflects both institutional failure and institutional accountability. On one hand, documents suggest Epstein exploited the territory's tax incentive programs and geographic features (private islands) to facilitate his alleged criminal enterprise while operating openly as a registered sex offender. On the other hand, the USVI's subsequent enforcement actions represent significant governmental effort to hold financial enablers accountable and recover damages for the territory.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing the documentary record might consider:

1. **Tax incentives were applied as designed.** The Virgin Islands Economic Development Commission granted incentives based on applications representing legitimate business purposes. If representations were fraudulent, responsibility lies with the applicant, not the jurisdiction. Many legitimate businesses operate under EDC incentives.

2. **Geographic jurisdiction does not imply governmental complicity.** Epstein owned property in multiple jurisdictions (Florida, New York, New Mexico, Paris). The USVI's status as location of his residence and island does not distinguish it from other jurisdictions where he operated.

3. **Enforcement actions demonstrate governmental response.** Rather than viewing USVI as an enabler, one could emphasize that the territory pursued enforcement actions that exceeded those of other jurisdictions. The JPMorgan complaint was filed by USVI, not by Florida, New York, or federal authorities.

4. **Settlement amounts reflect litigation economics.** The $75 million JPMorgan settlement and $105 million estate settlement may reflect defendants' assessments of litigation costs and risk management rather than acknowledged liability or proven facts.

5. **Registered sex offender status was public.** Epstein's status as a Tier 1 sex offender was a matter of public record. Institutions and individuals who engaged with him had access to this information; the jurisdiction's role was disclosure, not ongoing surveillance of his activities.

6. **Civil complaints contain unproven allegations.** The USVI v. JPMorgan complaint presents the government's theory of the case. Many specific allegations were never tested through trial. Defendants denied the allegations before settlement.

7. **Victim accounts describe adult experiences.** Some detailed accounts (e.g., Sarah Ransome's affidavit) describe experiences as an adult (age 22). While she observed others who "appeared to be young teenagers," her direct experience was not as a minor victim.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
