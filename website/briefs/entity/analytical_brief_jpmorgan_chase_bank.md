As a federally chartered bank, it operates under the regulatory oversight of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

Consent orders are formal enforcement actions issued by banking regulators when institutions are found to have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or have violated laws or regulations. The existence of this consent order indicates the bank was subject to regulatory action requiring corrective measures. [Source: occ-consent-order-2013-01-14]
