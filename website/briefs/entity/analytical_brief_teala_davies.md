## Statement of Public Interest

Teala Davies is among the women who publicly identified themselves as victims of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged sex trafficking operation. She provided a victim impact statement in federal court proceedings following Epstein's arrest in 2019, filed a civil lawsuit against his estate, and met with federal investigators. Her statements and filings contribute to the public understanding of allegations against Epstein and have become part of the public record through court proceedings and official document releases. The DOJ's 2025 release of documents related to the Epstein investigation includes interview notes that appear to correspond to Davies' account. This analysis serves informed public discourse about documented allegations and their resolution.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Based on our review of available court filings and public statements, Teala Davies appears in the documentary record as a self-identified victim who has publicly alleged that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused her when she was 17 years old. According to her lawsuit and public statements, she was introduced to Epstein in 2002 through her sister and alleges she was subsequently trafficked to Epstein's properties in New York, New Mexico, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and France. In our assessment, her decision to speak publicly—first at the August 2019 victim impact hearing and later through civil litigation—places her among the individuals who have contributed to the public understanding of allegations against Epstein. We note that while Davies spoke at the 2019 victim hearing and filed civil litigation, she was not among the four witnesses who testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 criminal trial.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations and factual information from court documents, victim impact statements, and official proceedings without editorial comment. Fair Report Privilege applies to accurate reporting of official proceedings.*

### Victim Impact Statement — August 27, 2019

On August 27, 2019, Judge Richard M. Berman of the Southern District of New York held a hearing in *United States v. Epstein*, No. 19-cr-490, inviting Epstein's accusers to provide victim impact statements following Epstein's death. Approximately 23 women spoke. Davies was among those who addressed the court.

**Statement of Teala Davies (August 27, 2019):**

> "I was going to start this statement by saying that I was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. But that's not the case. I'm still a victim of Jeffrey Epstein."

> "I'm still a victim because the fear of not being heard stopped me from telling my story for so many years."

> "I'm still a victim because I am fearful for my daughters and everyone's daughters. I'm fearful for their future in this world, where there are predators in power, a world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep enough."

> "I'm still a victim because the 17-year-old Teala was manipulated into thinking she had found someone who cared, someone who wanted to help."

> "He thought he was untouchable, and honestly, so did I. I thought he was the most powerful person I would ever meet. But the end is here, and here I stand, becoming more powerful than he will ever be."

Davies also stated to reporters outside the courthouse:

> "All I'm going to say is today is a day of power and strength."

### Civil Lawsuit — Davies v. Indyke (November 2019)

On November 21, 2019, Davies filed suit against Jeffrey Epstein's estate in the Southern District of New York. The case was styled *Davies v. Indyke*, No. 1:19-cv-10788 (S.D.N.Y.), naming estate executors Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as defendants.

**Allegations from the Complaint:**

According to news reports summarizing the filed complaint:

- Davies alleged she was first introduced to Epstein in 2002 through her sister, who was also allegedly being sexually abused by Epstein at the time.

- The complaint states: "Teala was unaware that Epstein had been manipulating and sexually abusing her sister, as Epstein's total power and control over Teala's sister made it impossible for her to say anything about it."

- The suit alleges Epstein "raped and sexually assaulted her frequently and in a variety of places and settings, including by trafficking Teala to his homes in New York, New Mexico, Florida, the Virgin Islands and France" at various times in the early 2000s.

- According to the complaint, Epstein arranged for Davies to study abroad in Spain to pursue her goal of becoming a translator. After she quit her job and gave up her apartment, Epstein allegedly began his sexual predation.

- The lawsuit alleges: "Epstein brought her to live a nomadic lifestyle in his close orbit. Teala traveled around the country with Epstein and his entourage, which generally included Maxwell, Kellen, and others."

- The complaint states that by 2004, the alleged abuse caused Davies to develop a severe eating disorder. When she disclosed this to Epstein, he allegedly "cast her out within hours of her admission" and sent her back to Arizona.

### Attorney Gloria Allred Press Conference — November 21, 2019

At a press conference announcing the lawsuit, attorney Gloria Allred provided context from her client's statement:

- Davies described herself as the "perfect victim" for a predator who targeted vulnerable underage teenagers and young women.

- Allred stated that Davies had a difficult childhood that included being homeless for a year at age 11.

- Allred provided a photograph showing Davies and Epstein in a helicopter flying over the U.S. Virgin Islands.

### DOJ Document Release — 2025

In 2025, the Department of Justice released documents related to the Epstein investigation pursuant to congressional legislation.

**FBI Interview Notes (July 2019):**

According to news reports, the release included handwritten notes from a July 2019 FBI interview. The accuser's name is redacted in the document, but reporting indicates the details match those publicly stated by Teala Davies:

- The interview notes reference "Campbell" going to Epstein's island with "Jean Luc" and "older people." Jean-Luc is believed to reference Jean-Luc Brunel, the modeling agent connected to Epstein.

- The photograph of Davies and Epstein on a helicopter, previously released by Gloria Allred in 2019, appears in the DOJ document release with Davies' face covered by a black box.

### Status Regarding Maxwell Criminal Trial

Based on available reporting, Davies was **not** among the four witnesses who testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 criminal trial. The four witnesses who testified were identified by pseudonyms or first names: Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Davies' role in the broader case:** In our assessment, Teala Davies occupies a notable position among Epstein accusers. She publicly identified herself, provided a victim impact statement in federal court, filed civil litigation, and cooperated with federal investigators. Her decision to forego anonymity distinguishes her from many trafficking victims who understandably seek privacy.

**Regarding the timing of her disclosures:** We observe that Davies' public statements came only after Epstein's arrest in July 2019 and death in August 2019. We interpret this timing as consistent with patterns seen among other accusers, where the prospect of justice—followed by its apparent foreclosure through Epstein's death—prompted public action.

**Regarding Maxwell's role according to Davies' allegations:** Davies' lawsuit and FBI interview notes reference Maxwell as part of Epstein's "entourage." While this suggests awareness of Maxwell's presence, the documentary record we reviewed does not indicate that Davies made specific allegations of misconduct by Maxwell. This may explain why she was not among the witnesses at Maxwell's criminal trial.

**Regarding the evidentiary value of the FBI interview notes:** The 2025 DOJ release of interview notes corroborating Davies' publicly stated account adds documentary weight to her allegations. The government apparently found her account credible enough to conduct and preserve a formal interview.

**Our editorial judgment:** Based on the available documentary record, we view Davies as a credible accuser who followed established legal channels to pursue accountability. Her willingness to provide public statements and cooperate with investigators, despite receiving no apparent direct benefit from Epstein's estate settlement at the time of her lawsuit filing, suggests motivations beyond financial recovery.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers reviewing the same documentary record might reach different conclusions:

1. **Davies' allegations remain unproven:** While Davies filed a civil lawsuit and made public statements, Epstein died before any legal adjudication of her specific claims. Her allegations, though documented, have never been tested through cross-examination or judicial findings.

2. **Civil litigation incentives:** Davies sued Epstein's substantial estate for compensatory and punitive damages. Some observers might view this financial dimension as relevant context for evaluating her claims, though seeking legal redress for alleged harm is a lawful exercise of rights.

3. **Absence from Maxwell trial:** Davies did not testify at Maxwell's 2021 criminal trial. This could suggest prosecutors did not find her account as central to the criminal charges, or it could reflect strategic decisions unrelated to credibility.

4. **Reliance on news reports:** Much of the public record regarding Davies comes from news coverage of her statements and lawsuit filings rather than directly reviewed court documents. This introduces a layer of reporting interpretation.

5. **Timing of disclosure:** Davies came forward publicly only after Epstein's death foreclosed criminal accountability. Some might view this timing skeptically, though others would note that trauma survivors often require time and triggering events before disclosure.

6. **Corroboration limitations:** While Davies' sister allegedly introduced her to Epstein and was also allegedly a victim, the extent of independent corroboration for Davies' specific allegations is unclear from the public record.

7. **Sister as alleged co-victim:** The allegation that Davies was introduced to Epstein by her own sister—who was allegedly being abused at the time—presents a complex family dynamic that might inform interpretation of the allegations in various ways.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through review of publicly available news reports, court filings accessible online, and official document releases.

**What we did not review:**
- The complete civil complaint in *Davies v. Indyke* (only news summaries were available)
- Any settlement or resolution documents from the civil case
- Full FBI interview notes (only news summaries of redacted documents)
- Any deposition transcripts of Davies
- Medical or psychological records referenced in litigation
- Documents still under seal

**Note on sourcing:** Unlike other briefs in The Continuum Report that draw primarily from ECF documents in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case, this brief relies heavily on news reports of court filings and official documents. This represents a limitation in direct source verification.

**Note on trial testimony:** While the task description referenced Davies' testimony at Maxwell's 2021 criminal trial, available evidence indicates she was not among the witnesses who testified at that trial. The four witnesses were identified as Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer.
