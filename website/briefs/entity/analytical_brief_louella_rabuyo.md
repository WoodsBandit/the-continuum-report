## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Louella Rabuyo was a housekeeper at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence who provided deposition testimony in 2009. Her testimony is significant because it documents a phone call from Ghislaine Maxwell on the morning that police executed a search warrant at Epstein's property—testimony that has been cited in connection with potential evidence spoliation. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Louella Rabuyo was a housekeeper employed at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence. She was deposed on October 20, 2009, and provided testimony that has become significant to understanding events on the day police executed a search warrant at the property. According to her testimony, Ghislaine Maxwell called her on the morning of the warrant execution and told her not to come in to work. This testimony, combined with other evidence that computers were removed from the residence before police arrived, has been cited in court filings discussing potential obstruction or spoliation of evidence. In our assessment, Rabuyo's testimony provides important contemporaneous evidence about communications and events on the day of the warrant execution. She appears in documents as a witness, not as someone accused of wrongdoing.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Rabuyo's testimony:** In our assessment, Louella Rabuyo's testimony regarding Maxwell's phone call on the day of the warrant execution is significant. The instruction not to come to work, combined with evidence that computers were removed from the property, raises questions about whether there was a coordinated effort to limit witnesses and remove evidence before police arrived.

**Regarding her role:** Rabuyo appears in documents as a household employee who provided truthful testimony about what she observed and experienced. There is no indication that she participated in any improper conduct; rather, her testimony documents the conduct of others.

**Regarding the spoliation context:** Rabuyo's testimony is part of a broader body of evidence regarding potential evidence spoliation at Epstein's residence. Her account of Maxwell's phone call is corroborated by other testimony about computer removal from property caretaker Janusz Banasiak.

**Regarding the timing:** The phone call occurred on the specific day of the warrant execution, suggesting advance knowledge of the police action. How this advance knowledge was obtained is not established in the documents we reviewed.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record shows Louella Rabuyo as a household employee whose testimony provides important evidence about events on the day of the warrant execution. Her account of Maxwell's phone call, combined with evidence of computer removal, contributes to the documentary record of potential obstruction.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Rabuyo was a truthful witness.** Her testimony provided information about events she observed, not accusations or opinions.

- **The phone call could have innocent explanations.** An employer telling a housekeeper not to come in could have many reasons unrelated to avoiding witnesses.

- **Rabuyo was not involved in any wrongdoing.** She was an employee who received a phone call; her testimony documents this, not any personal misconduct.

- **The timing may be coincidental.** Without evidence of how Maxwell knew about the warrant execution, the timing of the call could have other explanations.

- **Rabuyo cooperated with legal proceedings** by providing deposition testimony, suggesting she was a cooperative witness.

- **Her testimony was not challenged** on grounds of untruthfulness in the documents reviewed, suggesting it was considered reliable.

- **The phone call is one piece of evidence** that must be considered alongside other testimony about events that day.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
