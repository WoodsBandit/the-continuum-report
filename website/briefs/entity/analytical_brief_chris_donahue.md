## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Donahue was identified during standard discovery.** Discovery processes identify individuals who may have relevant knowledge.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Donahue.** The references appear in documents for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is very limited.** Two mentions do not provide extensive detail about any role.

- **Many witnesses appear in complex litigation.** Such identification is routine in comprehensive discovery.

- **The specific nature of the reference is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

- **The connection to the case may be tangential.** Limited mentions suggest peripheral rather than central involvement.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
