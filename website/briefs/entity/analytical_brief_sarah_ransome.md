## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Sarah Ransome provided a sworn affidavit dated January 5, 2017, filed in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation. Based on our review, Ransome was 22 years old in summer 2006 when she was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein and subsequently traveled to his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Her affidavit describes being "lent out" to others for sexual purposes and makes specific allegations regarding Ghislaine Maxwell's supervisory role over young women on the island. Ransome's affidavit also contains allegations against Alan Dershowitz. Ransome's account describes conduct that occurred when she was an adult, distinguishing her from the minor victims in the criminal case.

### The Ransome Affidavit

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24, pp. 2-3** and **[ECF Doc. 1331-32](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-32.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Sarah Ransome provided a sworn affidavit dated January 5, 2017, executed in Barcelona, Spain, before Hsiao-Ching Chang, Vice Consul of the United States of America.

**Paragraph 2 — Introduction to Epstein:**

> "In the summer of 2006, when I was twenty-two years old and living in New York, I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein by a girl I had met named Natalya Malyshov. Shortly after meeting Jeffrey he invited me to fly to his private island in the US Virgin Islands, which I did. After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction... As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, Nadia Macinkova, and various other girls and guests he brought to the island."

**Paragraph 3 — Observations of Ghislaine Maxwell:**

> "During one of my visits to the island I met Ghislaine Maxwell. Watching her interact with the other girls on the island, it became clear to me that she recruited all or many of them to the island. Once they were there, she appeared to be in charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with, and how they were supposed to stay in line. She assumed the same supervisory role with me as soon as I arrived. Some of the girls appeared to be 18 or older, but many appeared to be young teenagers. I recall seeing a particularly young, thin girl who looked well under 18 and recall asking her her age. I later learned was a ballerina. She refused to tell me or let me see her passport."

**Paragraph 4 — Allegations Regarding Alan Dershowitz:**

> "In addition to spending time with Jeffrey on his island, I spent time with him in New York City. At his town house I was also lent out by him to his friends and associates to have sex. Among the people he lent me to was his friend, Alan Dershowitz. On one occasion I was in a bedroom at Jeffrey's New York townhouse with Jeffrey and Nadia Marcinkova. After a short time, Alan Dershowitz entered the room, after which Jeffrey left the room and Nadia and I had sex with Dershowitz. I recall specific, key details of his person and the sex acts and can describe them in the event it becomes necessary to do so."

### Flight Log Documentation

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24, p. 2:**

> "On December 14, 2006 (Flight #1920), Sarah Ransome flew from TIST (USVI) to EWR (Newark, NJ) with Jeffrey Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova. See Giuffre 07139."

### Use in Litigation

Plaintiff's counsel in Giuffre v. Maxwell sought to use Ransome as a trial witness and filed motions regarding her testimony:

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf):**

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Ransome's age:** We note explicitly that Ransome was 22 years old—an adult—when the events she describes occurred. This distinguishes her from the minor victims in the Maxwell criminal case. However, her observations of the operation and of individuals who "appeared to be young teenagers" are relevant to understanding the broader pattern.

**Regarding Maxwell's role:** Ransome's description of Maxwell as someone who "appeared to be in charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with" corroborates other accounts of Maxwell's supervisory function. This observation from an adult participant provides additional perspective on Maxwell's alleged role.

**Regarding the Dershowitz allegation:** Ransome's affidavit contains specific allegations against Alan Dershowitz. Dershowitz has categorically denied any sexual contact with Ransome. We present the allegation as contained in the sworn affidavit without making a determination as to its accuracy.

**Regarding observations of minors:** Ransome's statement that "many appeared to be young teenagers" and her account of encountering a girl who "looked well under 18" provides an adult observer's perspective on the presence of minors in Epstein's operation.

**Our editorial judgment:** Ransome's affidavit provides a first-person account from within Epstein's operation. As an adult at the time, her observations carry the perspective of someone old enough to recognize and describe what she observed. Her account of Maxwell's role is consistent with the pattern established in the criminal conviction.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Adult status affects analysis.** Ransome was 22 years old during the events described. While exploitation of adults is also harmful, the legal and moral frameworks differ from cases involving minors.

2. **Observations are not evidence of specific crimes.** Ransome's statement that some girls "appeared to be young teenagers" reflects her perception but does not establish the ages of specific individuals or constitute evidence of crimes against those individuals.

3. **Allegations against Dershowitz are denied.** Dershowitz has categorically denied Ransome's allegations. Without adjudication, the competing accounts remain unresolved.

4. **The affidavit was prepared for litigation.** Sworn statements prepared in the context of civil litigation are advocacy documents. While made under oath, they represent one party's presentation of events.

5. **Corroboration of pattern, not specific acts.** Ransome's account corroborates the general pattern of Epstein's operation but describes her own experiences rather than directly witnessing crimes against others.

6. **Flight logs provide documentary support.** The flight log entry placing Ransome on Epstein's aircraft with Epstein and Marcinkova provides documentary corroboration of her presence.

7. **No criminal case involved Ransome.** Ransome was not a victim in the Maxwell criminal case, which focused on conduct with minors. Her account exists only in the civil litigation context.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
