## Statement of Public Interest

The property at 9 East 71st Street was Jeffrey Epstein's primary New York residence for nearly 25 years. Federal prosecutors alleged it was a location where sex trafficking occurred, and the 2019 federal raid recovered evidence central to the case against Epstein. The property's unusual transfer from Leslie Wexner to Epstein, reportedly for $0, has been the subject of public inquiry regarding the nature of their financial relationship. The property's sale in 2021 funded victim compensation, reflecting judicial determination that proceeds should benefit those harmed. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse regarding locations documented in federal prosecution and civil litigation.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The townhouse at 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan was one of the largest private residences in New York City, spanning approximately 51,000 square feet across nine floors. Based on our review of the documentary record, the property appears to have been central to Jeffrey Epstein's operations for nearly a quarter century. Court filings reference the New York residence as a location where alleged abuse occurred. The property's transfer from Leslie Wexner to Epstein, reportedly without monetary consideration around 1996, remains one of the more unusual aspects of their documented financial relationship. In July 2019, federal agents raided the property and recovered what prosecutors described as a "vast trove" of evidence including photographs. Following Epstein's death, the property was sold in March 2021 for approximately $51 million, with proceeds directed to the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented facts and direct quotations from court documents and official sources without editorial comment.*

**Property Characteristics:**

### The Wexner-Epstein Property Transfer

According to public reporting, Leslie Wexner transferred the property to Jeffrey Epstein around 1996. Property records indicate the transfer was made for $0. The New York Times reported that a Wexner spokeswoman stated he "severed ties" with Epstein a decade before the 2019 arrest.

**[ECF Doc. 1327-10](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-10.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

Deposition testimony confirmed awareness of the Wexner-Epstein relationship:

> Q. You know Mr. Les Wexner, correct?
> A. I do.

### Court Testimony Regarding the New York Property

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Affidavit of Sarah Ransome, dated January 5, 2017):

Ransome's affidavit specifically references Epstein's New York townhouse as a location where alleged activity occurred:

> "On one occasion I was in a bedroom at Jeffrey's New York townhouse with Jeffrey and Nadia Marcinkova. After a short time, Alan Dershowitz entered the room, after which Jeffrey left the room and Nadia and I had sex with Dershowitz."

**Note:** Sarah Ransome states she was 22 years old in 2006—an adult at the time of the events she describes. Alan Dershowitz has categorically denied this allegation.

**[ECF Doc. 1328-19](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-19.pdf), filed 01/05/24:**

According to media exhibits included in court filings, Virginia Giuffre alleged:

> "Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trained me to do what they wanted, including sexual activities and the use of sexual toys. The training was in New York and Florida at Epstein's mansions. It was basically every day and was like going to school... I was trained to be 'Everything a man wanted me to be.'"

**[ECF Doc. 1320-9](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-9.pdf), filed 01/03/24** (Motion for Joinder):

The motion referenced allegations occurring at multiple locations:

> The motion alleged that Epstein "required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

**Note:** Alan Dershowitz has categorically denied all allegations and has never been charged with any crime.

### The 2019 Federal Raid

On July 6, 2019, FBI agents and NYPD officers executed a search warrant at the 9 East 71st Street property in connection with the federal indictment of Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking charges in the Southern District of New York.

**Evidence Recovered (per federal prosecutors):**

According to federal court filings and statements by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York:

- Law enforcement recovered a "vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls"
- Compact discs with handwritten labels including: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude"
- A locked safe containing additional materials

The federal indictment alleged that Epstein committed sex trafficking offenses at the Manhattan residence.

### Property Sale and Victim Compensation

In March 2021, the property was sold to former Goldman Sachs executive Michael Daffey for approximately $51 million. The proceeds from the sale were directed to the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the property transfer:** In our assessment, the circumstances under which the 9 East 71st Street property transferred from Leslie Wexner to Jeffrey Epstein remain one of the most unusual aspects of their documented relationship. A property purchased for $13.2 million, reportedly transferred for $0 to a financial manager, represents an extraordinary transaction. We note that the full details of this transfer have never been publicly disclosed, and Wexner has stated he was deceived by Epstein and "severed ties" in 2007.

**Regarding the property as an alleged location of abuse:** Multiple sworn statements in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* litigation reference the New York property as a location where alleged abuse occurred. We observe that these are allegations from civil proceedings. The federal indictment in 2019 also alleged sex trafficking occurred at this location. Epstein died before trial, so these specific allegations were never adjudicated.

**Regarding the evidentiary significance:** The 2019 raid recovery of photographs and labeled media, as described by federal prosecutors, suggests the property may have served evidentiary purposes beyond serving as a residence. We note that Epstein maintained multiple residences (Palm Beach, Virgin Islands, New Mexico, Paris) and that the New York property appears to have been his primary base of operations based on the volume of allegations referencing it.

**Regarding the property's disposition:** The sale of the property and direction of proceeds to victim compensation represents an acknowledgment by the estate that victims should benefit from Epstein's assets. The $51 million sale price, while substantial, was below some market estimates, potentially reflecting the property's association with criminal allegations.

**Our editorial judgment:** The 9 East 71st Street property represents a significant physical location in the documentary record of the Epstein case. Its unusual acquisition, the allegations of abuse occurring there, the evidence recovered in 2019, and its ultimate sale for victim compensation all support its relevance to understanding the full scope of events. Questions remain about the original property transfer and the complete timeline of activities at this location.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents and public records might reasonably conclude:

1. **Property transfer may have legitimate explanation:** The transfer of the property from Wexner to Epstein may have had legitimate business or estate planning purposes not reflected in public records. Complex financial arrangements between wealthy individuals and their advisors can take unusual forms without indicating impropriety.

2. **Allegations remain unproven:** The allegations referencing the New York property come from civil litigation and sworn statements that were never tested at criminal trial due to Epstein's death. Allegations are not established facts.

3. **Evidence recovery does not establish guilt of others:** While federal agents recovered materials from the property, possession of materials does not establish the guilt of any person other than the property owner. Individuals named in allegations related to this property have denied wrongdoing.

4. **Wexner's account may be accurate:** Leslie Wexner has stated he was deceived by Epstein and was unaware of criminal activity. The property transfer may have occurred during a period when Wexner trusted Epstein as his financial manager, before any suspicions arose.

5. **Documentary limitations:** Available court documents provide an incomplete picture. Sealed materials, grand jury testimony, and FBI investigation files not in the public record may contain information that would affect interpretation of events at this location.

6. **Scale of property unremarkable for ultra-wealthy:** While 51,000 square feet is unusually large, extremely wealthy individuals in Manhattan sometimes maintain substantial residences. The property's size alone does not establish its use for illegal purposes.

7. **Sale price may reflect market conditions:** The $51 million sale price, below some estimates, may reflect real estate market conditions, property condition, or negotiation dynamics rather than solely the property's notoriety.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
