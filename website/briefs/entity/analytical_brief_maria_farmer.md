## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. Maria Farmer is documented as the first known individual to report Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse to federal authorities, filing complaints with the FBI and NYPD in 1996—years before any public attention to Epstein's criminal conduct. Her early reports and the subsequent failure of authorities to act raise significant questions about institutional response to allegations against wealthy and connected individuals. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Maria Farmer is an artist who worked for Jeffrey Epstein in the mid-1990s and is the older sister of Annie Farmer, who testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial as Minor Victim-2. Maria Farmer holds a unique and significant position in the Epstein documentary record: she is the first known person to report Epstein's criminal conduct to authorities, filing complaints with the FBI and NYPD in August 1996. Her complaints were not acted upon for approximately a decade. Maria Farmer has publicly alleged that she was sexually assaulted by both Epstein and Maxwell at Les Wexner's Ohio property in 1996. In our assessment, Maria Farmer's early reporting, the institutional failure to investigate her complaints, and the parallels between her experience and that of her younger sister Annie represent critical elements of the documentary record regarding both the scope of abuse and the failure of protective systems.

## The Public Record

*This section presents factual information from court documents and public records without editorial comment.*

### First Report to Authorities (1996)

Maria Farmer reported Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to the FBI and NYPD in August-September 1996.

According to documented records:
- **August 1996:** Maria Farmer reported her assault to the New York City Police Department
- **September 1996:** Maria Farmer filed a complaint with the FBI about Epstein's involvement in child sex abuse
- FBI did not act on the complaint for approximately one decade

### Employment and Assault

Maria Farmer was employed by Epstein as an artist in the mid-1990s. According to her public statements and court-referenced accounts:

- She worked as an artist-in-residence
- In May 1996, she was assaulted at Les Wexner's Ohio property
- Armed security at the property allegedly prevented her from leaving
- Both Epstein and Maxwell allegedly participated in the assault

### Connection to Annie Farmer

Maria Farmer introduced her younger sister Annie to Epstein:
- Annie was 15-16 years old at the time
- Annie was subsequently abused at Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996
- Annie testified at Maxwell's criminal trial, waiving her anonymity as Minor Victim-2
- Both sisters were among the earliest known victims, years before others came forward

### FBI Contact After Decade

According to documented sources:
- An FBI agent finally contacted Maria Farmer approximately ten years after her 1996 complaint
- This contact occurred only after the 2006 Palm Beach investigation began
- The decade-long gap between complaint and follow-up raised significant questions about institutional response

### Maxwell Trial Context

At Ghislaine Maxwell's federal criminal trial (2021):
- Annie Farmer testified as Minor Victim-2
- Maria Farmer's early reports to authorities were referenced as context
- The sisters' experiences demonstrated the operation's methods during the 1996 time period
- Maxwell was convicted on counts related to Annie Farmer's abuse

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Maria Farmer's historical significance:** In our assessment, Maria Farmer occupies a uniquely important position in the Epstein documentary record. Her 1996 complaints to the FBI and NYPD represent the earliest known formal reports of Epstein's criminal conduct—nearly a decade before the Palm Beach investigation that eventually led to his first prosecution.

**Regarding the institutional failure:** The FBI's failure to investigate Maria Farmer's 1996 complaint for approximately ten years represents, in our view, a significant institutional failure. The question of why her complaint went uninvestigated raises serious concerns about how authorities handle allegations against wealthy and connected individuals.

**Regarding the sisters' parallel experiences:** The fact that both Maria and Annie Farmer were victimized by Epstein in 1996—with Maria introducing her younger sister to Epstein—demonstrates the operation's methods. Annie's subsequent testimony at Maxwell's trial corroborated the pattern of grooming and abuse.

**Regarding the Wexner connection:** Maria Farmer's assault allegedly occurred at Les Wexner's Ohio property, establishing the connection between Epstein's activities and Wexner's properties during this early period.

**Our editorial judgment:** Maria Farmer's documented early reporting to authorities—and the failure of those authorities to act—represents one of the most troubling aspects of the institutional response to Epstein's crimes. Her persistence in coming forward publicly despite years of inaction demonstrates significant personal courage. The parallels between her experience and her sister's, combined with Annie's eventual testimony at the Maxwell trial, create a documented record of abuse spanning decades.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Institutional failures do not necessarily indicate conspiracy.** The FBI's failure to investigate the 1996 complaint may reflect bureaucratic dysfunction, resource constraints, or inadequate complaint intake processes rather than deliberate cover-up.

- **Memory and accounts evolve over time.** Accounts given decades after events may be influenced by subsequent publicity or the passage of time, though Maria Farmer's early contemporaneous reporting mitigates this concern.

- **The criminal justice system eventually did respond.** While delayed by many years, federal authorities ultimately prosecuted both Epstein and Maxwell, with Annie Farmer's testimony contributing to Maxwell's conviction.

- **Maria Farmer has not been cross-examined** in formal legal proceedings, meaning her full account has not been tested through adversarial process.

- **The Wexner connection remains circumstantial** regarding Wexner's personal knowledge. Epstein's access to Wexner properties does not establish Wexner's awareness of what occurred there.

- **Early reporting strengthens credibility.** The 1996 complaints, made years before any public attention to Epstein, suggest Maria Farmer's accounts were contemporaneous rather than influenced by subsequent publicity.

- **The conviction on counts related to Annie Farmer** provides some corroboration of the sisters' accounts of the operation's methods during this period.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
