## Statement of Public Interest

The INSLAW affair was the subject of a three-year congressional investigation that concluded the U.S. Department of Justice "acted willfully and fraudulently" in its dealings with a private software company. The case involves allegations of software theft, intelligence agency involvement, and the suspicious deaths of individuals connected to the investigation. Congressional findings of government misconduct establish clear public interest.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** The PROMIS/INSLAW affair represents one of the most significant alleged intelligence-related scandals of the 1980s. The case centers on PROMIS (Prosecutors Management Information System) software developed by INSLAW Inc. and allegations that the Department of Justice stole the software and distributed it, with modifications, to foreign governments and intelligence agencies. The House Judiciary Committee concluded after a three-year investigation that DOJ engaged in fraud against INSLAW. In our view, this case provides documented evidence of the intersection between government agencies, intelligence operations, and private enterprise that characterizes Intelligence Operations of The Continuum.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented facts from congressional records without editorial comment.*

### Congressional Investigation and Findings

The House Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas, conducted a three-year investigation into the INSLAW affair. The investigation was led by Chief Investigator James E. Lewin and Investigator John D. Cohen.

**House Judiciary Committee Report #102-857 (September 10, 1992):**

> "Two federal court judges and the House Judiciary Committee ultimately concluded that 'the Department of Justice acted willfully and fraudulently' and 'took, converted and stole' INSLAW's enhanced PROMIS software by 'trickery, fraud and deceit.'"

### Background: The PROMIS Software

PROMIS (Prosecutors Management Information System) was originally developed with federal funding through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) in the 1970s. According to congressional records:

- INSLAW (originally the Institute for Law and Social Research) was a non-profit organization funded by government grants to develop case management software for law enforcement
- By 1980, two of the largest U.S. Attorney's Offices were using PROMIS for criminal and civil cases
- In 1981, INSLAW Inc. created significant privately-financed enhancements to PROMIS and began commercial marketing
- In March 1982, the Department of Justice awarded INSLAW a $10 million, three-year contract

### The Contract Dispute

According to the congressional report, the dispute centered on ownership of privately-funded enhancements:

> "The three-year contract became embroiled in controversy when the government demanded that INSLAW deliver under the contract a version of PROMIS that the new INSLAW, Inc. had developed in 1981 with private funds."

The bankruptcy court found that by November 1982, DOJ had "launched a scheme fraudulently to induce INSLAW to deliver under the contract a later, privately-financed version of PROMIS."

### Alleged Intelligence Distribution

The congressional report examined allegations regarding unauthorized distribution of PROMIS:

> "Information obtained by the Hamiltons through sworn affidavits of several individuals, including Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli Mossad officer, and Michael Riconosciuto, who claimed to have ties to the intelligence community, indicated that one element of the Justice Department's malfeasance against INSLAW was the modification of the 'enhanced' PROMIS software by individuals associated with the world of covert intelligence operations."

The report noted allegations that PROMIS was modified to include a "trap-door" allowing covert access to systems using the software.

### Key Figures in Congressional Testimony

The congressional investigation examined testimony and affidavits from multiple individuals:

- **Bill and Nancy Hamilton** — INSLAW owners who filed the original complaints
- **Ari Ben-Menashe** — Self-described former Israeli Mossad officer who provided affidavit
- **Michael Riconosciuto** — Individual claiming intelligence community ties who provided affidavit
- **Earl Brian** — Reagan associate who controlled Hadron Inc., which had approached INSLAW about acquisition

### Hadron Inc. and Earl Brian

The congressional report documented:

> "Hadron, Inc. was controlled by the Biotech Capital Corporation, the holding company of Dr. Earl Brian, a Ronald Reagan crony. In his deposition to the House Judiciary Committee, Brian testified that Hadron had approximately 40 computer system contracts with U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. Department of Justice."

The Hamiltons alleged that Hadron's chairman "threatened him in 1983, when he declined any interest in INSLAW's acquisition by Hadron, by saying ominously 'we have ways of making you sell.'"

### Attempt to Force Liquidation

The congressional report found:

> "Both the bankruptcy and district courts ruled that Justice then sought 'unlawfully and without justification' to convert INSLAW from Chapter 11 reorganization into Chapter 7 liquidation to incapacitate the Company from litigating."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the congressional findings:** The House Judiciary Committee's conclusion that DOJ "acted willfully and fraudulently" and engaged in "trickery, fraud and deceit" is a significant finding from a congressional investigation. While Congress cannot impose criminal penalties, these findings represent an official determination of misconduct.

**Regarding intelligence distribution allegations:** The claims that PROMIS was modified with a "trap-door" and distributed to foreign governments and intelligence agencies are serious allegations that were examined, but not definitively proven, by the congressional investigation. The affidavits from Ari Ben-Menashe and Michael Riconosciuto were examined but remain subject to questions about reliability.

**Regarding Robert Maxwell:** Published accounts, including Whitney Webb's "One Nation Under Blackmail" (2022), allege that Robert Maxwell was involved in distributing PROMIS software internationally on behalf of Israeli intelligence. The congressional investigation examined some of these allegations. Maxwell died in 1991 before the congressional report was published.

**Regarding the lack of prosecutions:** Despite congressional findings of fraud and misconduct, no criminal prosecutions resulted from the INSLAW investigation. This lack of accountability is notable given the severity of the findings.

**Our editorial judgment:** The PROMIS/INSLAW affair represents a documented case where congressional investigation found government misconduct involving software theft and potential intelligence agency involvement. The case connects to the Epstein Network through the alleged involvement of Robert Maxwell (father of Ghislaine Maxwell). In our view, this case exemplifies the type of intelligence-related operation that characterizes Intelligence Operations of The Continuum.

## Alternative Interpretations

- **Contract dispute view:** The INSLAW affair may have been primarily a routine contract dispute that was mischaracterized by the Hamiltons and others as a conspiracy. Contract disputes between government and private companies are common.

- **Witness reliability concerns:** Key witnesses including Michael Riconosciuto have faced credibility challenges. Riconosciuto provided his affidavit while incarcerated. Ari Ben-Menashe's claims have been disputed by some researchers.

- **Congressional limitations:** Congressional investigations cannot establish criminal guilt. The lack of prosecutions may indicate insufficient evidence for criminal charges rather than cover-up.

- **Separation from Epstein network:** While Robert Maxwell's alleged involvement creates a link to the Epstein network through family relationships, the PROMIS affair predates the documented Epstein criminal enterprise. The connection may be historical rather than operational.

- **Complexity of claims:** The INSLAW affair involves layers of interconnected allegations that are difficult to verify. Some claims may be accurate while others may be embellished or inaccurate.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
