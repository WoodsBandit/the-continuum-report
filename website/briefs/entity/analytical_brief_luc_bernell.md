## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Bernell was identified during standard discovery.** Discovery processes identify individuals who may have relevant knowledge.

- **The name may be a variant or error.** Similar names like Jean-Luc Brunel are documented separately.

- **Identification does not imply wrongdoing.** Being named in discovery reflects potential knowledge, not accusation.

- **There are no allegations against Bernell.** The references appear for identification purposes only.

- **The documentary record is very limited.** Two mentions do not provide extensive detail about any role.

- **Name variations occur in legal documents.** Spelling differences and OCR errors are common.

- **The specific nature of the reference is unclear.** Without more documentation, conclusions should be tentative.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
