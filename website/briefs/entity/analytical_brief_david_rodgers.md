## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. David Rodgers was Jeffrey Epstein's pilot and maintained flight logs that became significant evidence in civil and criminal proceedings. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** David Rodgers served as a pilot for Jeffrey Epstein and operated Epstein's private aircraft, including the Boeing 727 that media later dubbed the "Lolita Express." Rodgers maintained detailed flight logs documenting passengers, destinations, and dates of flights. These logs became critical evidence in both civil litigation and criminal proceedings, documenting the travel patterns of Epstein, his associates, and various prominent individuals. Rodgers was deposed in the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation on June 3, 2016. In our assessment, the flight logs he maintained constitute some of the most important documentary evidence regarding Epstein's operations. Rodgers has never been charged with any wrongdoing; he appears in the court records as an employee who provided testimony about his observations.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations from court documents without editorial comment.*

### Deposition Testimony

**[ECF Doc. 1328-14](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-14.pdf), filed 01/05/24** (Deposition of David Rodgers):

### Flight Log Evidence

**[ECF Doc. 1331-32](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-32.pdf)** (Flight Log References):

**[ECF Doc. 1328-24](/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-24.pdf), filed 01/05/24**:

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Rodgers' evidentiary significance:** In our assessment, the flight logs maintained by David Rodgers represent some of the most important documentary evidence regarding Epstein's operations. Unlike witness testimony, which can be challenged on grounds of memory or bias, flight logs are contemporaneous records that provide objective documentation of who traveled where and when.

**Regarding his role:** The documentary record suggests Rodgers served in an employee capacity as a pilot. His deposition testimony appears to have been offered as a witness with relevant knowledge, not as an accused party.

**Regarding the flight logs' use in litigation:** Court filings repeatedly cite the flight logs to establish patterns of travel and association. For example, filings stated that Maxwell traveled with Giuffre 23 times while Giuffre was underage and that Maxwell was on Epstein's aircraft over 300 times. These figures derive from records Rodgers maintained.

**Regarding absence of allegations:** We observe that the court records do not contain allegations against Rodgers himself. He appears in the documentary record as an employee who provided testimony about his observations and who maintained records that became important evidence.

**Our editorial judgment:** David Rodgers occupies a unique position in the Epstein documentary record—not as an alleged participant in wrongdoing, but as the keeper of records that documented travel patterns crucial to understanding Epstein's operations. The flight logs he maintained have been cited in numerous court filings and public reporting.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Rodgers was an employee doing his job.** Pilots are required to maintain flight logs as a matter of aviation regulation. His record-keeping reflected professional obligation, not participation in or awareness of any illegal activity.

- **The absence of charges against Rodgers** suggests prosecutors and investigators did not believe he was involved in criminal conduct.

- **Rodgers cooperated with legal proceedings** by providing deposition testimony, which may indicate he was a cooperative witness rather than a target.

- **Flight logs document presence, not conduct.** Being on an aircraft does not establish knowledge of or participation in any illegal activity that may have occurred at destinations.

- **Many passengers on Epstein's aircraft** were legitimate business associates, friends, or employees traveling for lawful purposes. The logs do not distinguish between innocent travel and travel related to alleged crimes.

- **Rodgers' testimony was factual in nature** — describing who was on flights and when — rather than providing interpretive or accusatory information.

- **As a pilot, Rodgers' observations** would have been limited to who boarded aircraft and where flights went, not to activities occurring at residences or other locations.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
