## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Goldberger's role:** In our assessment, Jack Goldberger served as defense counsel for Jeffrey Epstein—a constitutional role that all criminal defendants are entitled to regardless of the charges they face. His representation reflects the functioning of the adversarial legal system.

**Regarding criminal defense representation:** The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel. Defense attorneys who represent unpopular clients perform a necessary function in the justice system. We observe that Goldberger's representation of Epstein reflects this principle.

**Regarding the NPA outcome:** Goldberger was part of the defense team during the period when the Non-Prosecution Agreement was negotiated. The NPA's terms have been widely criticized, but we note that defense counsel's role is to advocate for their client's interests within the bounds of law and ethics.

**Our editorial judgment:** Jack Goldberger appears in the documentary record as a legal professional who represented Jeffrey Epstein. His role as defense counsel reflects the adversarial system's requirement that all defendants receive legal representation.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Goldberger performed his professional duty.** Defense attorneys are ethically obligated to provide competent representation to their clients regardless of the charges.

- **Criminal defense is constitutionally guaranteed.** The Sixth Amendment requires that all defendants have access to counsel; Goldberger fulfilled this role.

- **Attorneys advocate within legal bounds.** Defense counsel's role is to present the best case for their client while adhering to legal and ethical rules.

- **The NPA was negotiated with prosecutors.** The agreement's terms reflected negotiations between defense counsel and prosecutors; any criticism of those terms involves both sides.

- **No allegations exist against Goldberger.** He appears in documents solely in his professional capacity as an attorney.

- **Defense representation does not imply endorsement.** Attorneys who represent accused individuals do not thereby endorse their clients' alleged conduct.

- **Professional obligations govern attorney conduct.** Goldberger would have been bound by Florida Bar rules in his representation of Epstein.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
