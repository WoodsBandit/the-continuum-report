## Statement of Public Interest

Roy Cohn was a prominent American attorney who served as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy hearings. He later became a powerful New York attorney and political fixer with clients including Donald Trump. Published accounts and sworn testimony allege Cohn's involvement in sexual blackmail operations. His documented relationships with organized crime figures, intelligence operatives, and political leaders establish public interest.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Roy Cohn represents a documented historical nexus between political power, organized crime, and alleged sexual blackmail operations. Published accounts, including Whitney Webb's "One Nation Under Blackmail" (2022), detail allegations that Cohn participated in sexual blackmail schemes targeting politicians and other influential figures. These allegations are supported by sworn testimony from Susan Kaufman, ex-wife of liquor magnate Lewis Rosenstiel, and investigative findings from former NYPD detective James Rothstein. In our analytical framework, Cohn exemplifies how political fixers can operate at the intersection of legitimate power and criminal enterprises, with sexual blackmail as a tool of influence.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented facts and attributed allegations without editorial comment.*

### Career Background

Roy Marcus Cohn (1927-1986) was an American attorney who rose to prominence as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy hearings (1954). Following his government service, Cohn became a powerful New York attorney representing clients including:

- Donald Trump (real estate developer)
- Rupert Murdoch (media executive)
- Various organized crime figures
- Catholic Archdiocese of New York

Cohn was disbarred by the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate Division in June 1986 for unethical conduct. He died of AIDS-related complications on August 2, 1986.

### Susan Kaufman Testimony

Susan Kaufman, ex-wife of liquor magnate Lewis Rosenstiel, provided sworn testimony regarding alleged sexual blackmail operations involving Cohn and Rosenstiel.

**Context Note:** Susan Kaufman provided this testimony during contentious divorce proceedings from Lewis Rosenstiel. Readers should consider this context when evaluating the testimony.

**Whitney Webb, "One Nation Under Blackmail" (2022), citing Kaufman testimony:**

> "In 1958, Kaufman accompanied her husband Lewis Rosenstiel to a 'party' hosted by Cohn at the Plaza Hotel in New York."

Kaufman testified that these gatherings at the Plaza Hotel (allegedly Suite 233, termed the "blue suite") involved sexual activity that could be used for blackmail purposes.

### James Rothstein Statements

Former NYPD detective James Rothstein, former head of the department's Human Trafficking and Vice-Related Crimes Division, conducted interviews with Cohn.

**Webb, citing Rothstein's statements to John DeCamp:**

> "Cohn's job was to run the little boys. Say you had an admiral, a general, a congressman, who did not want to go along with the program. Cohn's job was to set them up, then they would go along. Cohn told me that himself."

### John Klotz Investigation

New York attorney John Klotz, investigating Cohn for a case, found independent evidence of the Plaza Hotel operation.

**Webb, citing Klotz's statements to Burton Hersh:**

> "Roy Cohn was providing protection. There were a bunch of pedophiles involved. That's where Cohn got his power from — blackmail."

### Lewis Rosenstiel Connection

Lewis Rosenstiel was the founder of Schenley Industries, a major American liquor company. He had documented connections to organized crime figures including Meyer Lansky.

**Webb:**

> "Lansky was known to address Rosenstiel as 'Supreme Commander,' a name that Roy Cohn, Rosenstiel's attorney and close friend, also used for the liquor baron."

### J. Edgar Hoover Connection

Published accounts allege Cohn's relationship with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, including claims that Hoover attended parties at the Plaza Hotel.

**Webb, citing Kaufman:**

> "There is also evidence that, not only did these parties at the Plaza hotel take place, but that they were used to obtain sexual blackmail, with Kaufman asserting that her husband possessed pictures of Hoover wearing women's clothes and that those images had been passed to Rosenstiel's associate, mobster Meyer Lansky."

### Donald Trump Connection

Roy Cohn served as Donald Trump's attorney and mentor from the 1970s until Cohn's death in 1986. Trump has publicly acknowledged Cohn's influence on his approach to conflict.

**New York Times (January 4, 2018):**

Trump reportedly asked "Where's my Roy Cohn?" when frustrated with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the Plaza Hotel allegations:** Multiple independent sources — Susan Kaufman's sworn testimony, James Rothstein's statements, and John Klotz's investigation — describe sexual blackmail operations involving Roy Cohn at the Plaza Hotel. While these are not court-adjudicated facts, the convergence of sources is notable.

**Regarding the blackmail mechanism:** The alleged operation follows a documented pattern: compromising material is gathered on targets through orchestrated sexual encounters, then used to ensure cooperation. Rothstein's characterization of Cohn's role — "to run the little boys" and "set them up" — describes a systematic operation rather than isolated incidents.

**Regarding organized crime connections:** Cohn's relationships with organized crime figures including Lewis Rosenstiel and Meyer Lansky are documented. These connections placed Cohn at the intersection of legitimate political power and criminal enterprises.

**Regarding political influence:** Cohn's client list included future President Donald Trump, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and numerous other influential figures. If the blackmail allegations are accurate, this network represented significant potential for political influence.

**Regarding historical continuity:** In our editorial assessment, the allegations surrounding Roy Cohn represent a historical precedent for the types of operations allegedly conducted by Jeffrey Epstein decades later. The Plaza Hotel operation, if it existed as described, would represent an earlier iteration of sexual blackmail targeting powerful figures.

**Our editorial judgment:** Roy Cohn represents a documented historical figure whose alleged activities prefigure later patterns documented in The Continuum. While the blackmail allegations cannot be court-verified due to Cohn's death and the passage of time, the multiple independent sources warrant inclusion in our analysis of historical patterns.

## Alternative Interpretations

- **Unreliable witnesses:** Susan Kaufman was in a contentious divorce from Lewis Rosenstiel when she provided testimony. Her accounts may be colored by personal animus.

- **Post-mortem allegations:** Many allegations against Cohn emerged after his death when he could not respond. This limits reliability.

- **McCarthy-era antagonism:** Cohn made powerful enemies during the McCarthy era. Some allegations may reflect political opposition rather than fact.

- **Unverified claims:** The blackmail allegations are based on testimony and interviews, not physical evidence or court findings.

- **Conflation of activities:** Cohn's documented unethical behavior (leading to disbarment) may have been conflated with more serious allegations that are unproven.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
