# Analytical Brief: University Street

## Executive Summary

University Street (383 University Street, Salt Lake City, UT 84112) appears throughout court documents in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation (Case No. 15-cv-07433-LAP, S.D.N.Y.) as the institutional address of the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah. This address is consistently associated with Professor Paul G. Cassell, who represented Virginia Giuffre and other victims in Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) proceedings against Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement.

The entity appears in court filings as part of attorney signature blocks and certificates of service, identifying Professor Cassell's institutional affiliation. Professor Cassell, a former federal judge and prominent victims' rights advocate, played a significant role in the CVRA litigation that challenged the secret plea deal between federal prosecutors and Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. His involvement brought academic and legal expertise from the University of Utah's law school into the Epstein-related litigation.

The address appears across 35 total mentions in 8 unique source documents, consistently in the context of legal representation rather than any substantive connection to the underlying allegations. The S.J. Quinney College of Law itself is not a party to any litigation; the address serves solely to identify Professor Cassell's professional affiliation.

## Activity Summary

University Street's role in the Epstein-related litigation is exclusively administrative, serving to identify Professor Cassell's institutional affiliation. The address establishes:

1. **Academic Credentials**: Identifies Cassell as a law professor rather than private practitioner, lending institutional credibility to victims' representation.

2. **Pro Hac Vice Basis**: Provides the Utah address for an attorney appearing in New York federal court proceedings.

3. **Service Address**: Serves as a location for service of legal documents to Professor Cassell.

4. **Institutional Independence**: The University of Utah affiliation distinguishes Cassell's involvement from the commercial law firms also representing the plaintiffs.

The institution itself (S.J. Quinney College of Law, University of Utah) is not a party to any litigation and has no substantive connection to the underlying allegations. The address appears solely in the context of attorney identification.

## Assessment

### Significance Level: PROCEDURAL

University Street is a supporting administrative reference in the Epstein litigation. Its importance lies in:
- Identifying the institutional affiliation of a key attorney
- Establishing academic credentials for victims' representation
- Providing service address information for legal proceedings

### Classification Note

This entity should be considered for potential consolidation with related entities:
- **Quinney College** (25 mentions across 25 documents) - Same institution, different extraction
- **Salt Lake City** - Geographic context for the address

### Information Gaps

- Specific dates of Professor Cassell's pro hac vice admissions
- Full record of CVRA filings attributed to the University of Utah address
- Connection to any University of Utah clinical programs or student involvement

### Areas Requiring Further Investigation

1. Whether other University of Utah faculty or resources supported the CVRA litigation
2. The timeline of Professor Cassell's transition from the CVRA case to Giuffre v. Maxwell
3. Any amicus briefs or academic publications from the institution related to the case

### Recommendation

Given that University Street is an institutional address appearing in attorney signature blocks rather than a location of substantive significance, this brief is provided for completeness of the entity index. Human reviewers should consider whether this entity warrants inclusion in the public-facing database or should be flagged as "PROCEDURAL - ATTORNEY ADDRESS" and excluded from primary navigation.
