# ANALYTICAL BRIEF: US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT or DOT) is the fourth-largest federal agency, tasked with ensuring safe, efficient, sustainable, and equitable movement of people and goods. Operating across 10 operating administrations and managing approximately 95,000 employees, the DOT oversees all major transportation modes—aviation, highway, rail, transit, maritime, and pipeline safety. Led by Secretary Sean P.
