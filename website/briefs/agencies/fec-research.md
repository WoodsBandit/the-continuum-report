## 5. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES

### Chronic Deadlock
- 1996-2006: 2.4% deadlock rate
- 2014: 24.4% deadlock
- 2016: >30% deadlock on substantive votes
- 2012-present: 50.6% enforcement matters have deadlock

### Quorum Crises
- 2008: Shutdown under Bush
- 2019-2020: Lost quorum (446 cases backlogged)
- May 2025: Current shutdown (only 3 commissioners)

### Citizens United Impact (2010)
- Authorized unlimited corporate/labor spending
- Dark money: <$5.2M (2006) → $1B+ (2020)
- FEC failed to enforce coordination rules

### Enforcement Failures
- Zero penalties for illegal coordination since Citizens United
- Only one criminal conviction (2015): DOJ prosecuted, not FEC
- Penalty amounts stagnant since 2004 despite spending tripling

### Structural Design Flaws
- Even number (6) prevents tie-breaking
- 4-vote supermajority requirement
- Commissioners nominated for ideological opposition to FEC mission

---

## 6. RELATIONSHIPS

- DOJ: Criminal prosecution authority (FEC has civil only)
- IRS: Overlapping jurisdiction on 501(c)(4) political spending
- GAO: Recommended agencies update coordination practices
