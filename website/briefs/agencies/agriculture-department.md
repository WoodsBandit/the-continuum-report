## MISSION STATEMENT

"To serve all Americans by providing effective, innovative, science-based public policy leadership in agriculture, food and nutrition, natural resource protection and management, rural development, and related issues."

## HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

### Formation and Original Purpose
President Abraham Lincoln established the USDA on May 15, 1862, calling it "The People's Department" because at the time, approximately half of Americans lived on farms. The department was elevated to Cabinet status in 1889 under President Grover Cleveland.

### Key Historical Developments
- **1862**: Created by Lincoln; same year as Homestead Act and Morrill Land-Grant Act
- **1889**: Elevated to Cabinet status under Cleveland
- **1906**: Meat Inspection Act passed following "The Jungle" exposé
- **1933**: Agricultural Adjustment Act during Great Depression; beginning of modern farm subsidies
- **1939**: Food Stamp Program pilot (became permanent 1964, renamed SNAP 2008)
- **1964**: Food Stamp Act made program permanent
- **1970**: OSHA transferred workplace safety to Labor; USDA retained agriculture focus
- **1994**: USDA reorganized into mission areas

### "The People's Department" Reality Check
While Lincoln's vision positioned USDA as serving all Americans, the department's modern reality reveals significant disparities in who actually benefits from its programs, particularly in farm subsidies.

## BUDGET & FUNDING

### FY2025 Budget Breakdown

| Category | Amount | % of Total |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Total Estimated Outlays** | $231 billion | 100% |
| **Mandatory Programs** | $189.6 billion | 82.1% |
| **Discretionary Appropriations** | $26.2 billion | 11.3% |

### Major Program Spending

| Program | FY2024 Amount |
|---------|---------------|
| **SNAP (Food Stamps)** | $99.8 billion (70% of nutrition spending) |
| **Crop Insurance Premium Subsidies** | $10.4 billion |
| **Direct Subsidy Payments** | $9.3 billion |

### The SNAP Dominance
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program represents the majority of USDA's budget—feeding 41.7 million Americans monthly. This makes USDA as much a welfare agency as an agriculture agency, a fact often obscured in political discussions.

## PUBLIC RECORD

### Farm Subsidy Distribution Inequality

**The Concentration Problem**
Farm subsidy distribution reveals extreme concentration:
- **Top 10% of recipients**: Receive 73% of all payments (~$91,000/farm average)
- **Bottom 80% of recipients**: Receive less than $3,000 annually
- **90% of all subsidies**: Go to just 5 crops (wheat, corn, cotton, rice, soybeans)

**Demographic Disparities**
Documented inequities in subsidy distribution:
- Black, Hispanic, and female farmers consistently receive lower payments
- Historical USDA discrimination against Black farmers (Pigford settlements)
- Large corporate operations receive majority of support

### Commodity Checkoff Program Controversies

**The Mandatory Assessment System**
USDA oversees 22 commodity "checkoff" programs where farmers are required to pay assessments for industry promotion (beef, pork, dairy, eggs, etc.). Farmers cannot opt out.

**Documented Issues**:
- **First Amendment challenges**: Compelled speech concerns in mandatory assessments
- **2013 Egg Board scandal**: Attempted to sabotage "Just Mayo" plant-based competitor
- **2000 Pork Checkoff**: 53% of farmers voted to end program; referendum results ignored
- **Farm Action Report**: USDA failed oversight requirements; documented history of fraud
- **Industry capture**: Programs frequently benefit large processors over small farmers

### Food Safety Recall Record

**2012-2023 Summary**:
- 1,001 food safety recalls
- 205.2 million pounds of product recalled
- Common causes: E. coli, metal contamination, undeclared allergens

**Jurisdictional Gap**:
USDA inspects meat, poultry, and eggs. FDA handles everything else. The arbitrary threshold:
- ≥3% raw meat = USDA jurisdiction
- ≥2% cooked poultry = USDA jurisdiction
- Pizza with pepperoni? FDA. Frozen meat pizza? USDA.

## CONNECTIONS TO OTHER ENTITIES

### Federal Agency Coordination

| Agency | Coordination Area |
|--------|-------------------|
| **FDA** | Food safety (USDA: meat/poultry; FDA: everything else) |
| **EPA** | Pesticide regulation (post-1972 authority transfer under FIFRA) |
| **Interior** | Land management (Forest Service/BLM coordination) |
| **HHS** | Nutrition policy, dietary guidelines |

### The USDA-FDA Food Safety Split
One of the most criticized aspects of American food regulation:
- USDA: Meat, poultry, eggs (continuous inspection required)
- FDA: All other foods (risk-based inspection)
- Duplicate regulatory systems, jurisdictional gaps
- Multiple failed attempts at consolidation (proposed "single food agency")

### Industry Relationships
- Direct commodity group relationships through checkoff programs
- Agricultural lobby among most powerful in Washington
- "Revolving door" between industry and USDA positions
- Land-grant university system creates research partnerships

## EDITORIAL ANALYSIS

### The Farm Bill Industrial Complex

The USDA operates at the center of one of Washington's most powerful political ecosystems: the Farm Bill coalition. Every five years, this legislation combines nutrition assistance (primarily SNAP) with agricultural subsidies in a political marriage of convenience that ensures bipartisan passage.

The arrangement serves political purposes: rural Republicans support nutrition funding in exchange for urban Democrats supporting farm subsidies. Whether this produces good policy is questionable. The result is a system where 82% of spending is mandatory, leaving little room for reform or adaptation.

### Subsidies: Who Really Benefits?

The rhetoric of farm subsidies centers on the family farmer. The reality is that modern agriculture is industrial, and subsidies flow accordingly. When 73% of payments go to the top 10% of recipients, the "family farm" justification becomes increasingly difficult to sustain.

The concentration in five crops (corn, wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans) further distorts. These aren't chosen for nutritional value or environmental sustainability—they're chosen because they have the most effective lobbying operations. Specialty crop farmers (fruits, vegetables, nuts) receive comparatively minimal support.

### Checkoff Programs: Compelled Speech?

The mandatory checkoff system presents genuine constitutional questions. Requiring dairy farmers to fund "Got Milk?" campaigns or beef producers to fund "Beef: It's What's for Dinner" compels commercial speech. Several Supreme Court cases have addressed this tension without fully resolving it.

More practically, checkoff funds often benefit large processors more than the farmers paying the assessments. The Egg Board's documented campaign against plant-based alternatives reveals these programs can be weaponized against market competition.

## ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS

### The Agricultural Industry Perspective
Supporters of current policy argue:
- Farm subsidies ensure stable domestic food supply
- Crop insurance prevents farm failures during disasters
- Checkoff programs build markets that benefit all producers
- SNAP funding belongs in USDA because it supports agricultural demand

### The Reform Perspective
Critics contend that:
- Subsidies distort markets and primarily benefit large operations
- Checkoff programs are captured by industry interests
- SNAP should be separated from agriculture policy
- Environmental costs of subsidized crops (corn ethanol, excess fertilizer) ignored

### The Small Farmer Perspective
Independent farmer advocates argue:
- Current system systematically disadvantages small and minority farmers
- Consolidation is accelerating, driven partly by subsidy structure
- Beginning farmer programs are underfunded compared to established operations
- Checkoff assessments burden small producers disproportionately
