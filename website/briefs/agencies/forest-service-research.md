## 5. DOCUMENTED CONTROVERSIES

### Wildfire Budget Crisis
- 1995: 16% of budget → 2005: 50%+ of budget
- Borrowing from other programs became unsustainable
- 2018 disaster fund attempted fix
- Escalating costs from inflated pricing

- Base pay historically: $15/hour
- 50% permanent staff lost since 2020
- 30-50% of ~11,000 firefighters could resign
- Union accusations of "wage theft"
- Recent increases insufficient for retention
- Staffing down 27-29% (2025)

### Fire Prevention Work Backlog
- Prescribed burns, tree thinning slowed dramatically (2025)
- Some locations lost 40% non-fire staffing
- Firefighters pulled for suppression during prevention season
- Targets repeatedly reduced due to workforce depletion

### Logging vs. Conservation
- One Big Beautiful Bill Act: 250M board feet mandate through 2034
- Mature tree logging raises wildfire risk concerns
- Climate and ecosystem impact tensions
- Policy pressure vs. ecological evidence conflict
