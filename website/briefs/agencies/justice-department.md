## Historical Overview

### Founding & Origins

The Department of Justice was established on June 22, 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant signed legislation creating the department, which became operative July 1, 1870. However, the Office of the Attorney General—the nation's chief legal officer—was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789, making it one of the original four Cabinet positions.

The department was created to consolidate federal legal functions previously scattered across multiple agencies and to address the massive legal challenges of Reconstruction. The Attorney General leads the department and serves as chief law enforcement officer of the federal government.

**Key Legislation:**
- Judiciary Act of 1789 (creating Attorney General position)
- Act to Establish the Department of Justice (June 22, 1870)
- Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968
- USA PATRIOT Act of 2001

### Evolution

- **1789:** Office of Attorney General created
- **1870:** Department of Justice formally established
- **1908:** Bureau of Investigation created (renamed FBI 1935)

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented information from official sources.*

### INSLAW/PROMIS Scandal (1980s-1990s)

**Background:** Inslaw, Inc. developed PROMIS case management software under $9.6 million DOJ contract (March 1982).

**Bankruptcy Court Findings (1988):**

> The court ruled DOJ converted PROMIS through "trickery, fraud and deceit" after reviewing 23 witnesses and 280+ exhibits. Inslaw awarded $7 million in damages.
>
> — [Bankruptcy Court Ruling, 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inslaw)

**Key Allegations:**
- DOJ allegedly stole Enhanced PROMIS software
- Unauthorized modifications introduced backdoor surveillance capabilities
- Software distributed to 40+ countries without Inslaw's knowledge
- PROMIS allegedly provided to CIA, NSA, Mossad with backdoor access

**Later Developments:**
- July 1997: Judge ruled PROMIS in public domain
- FBI opened as "Major Case" (ranked with 9/11, bin Laden, Anthrax)
- Multiple congressional investigations; special counsel appointed
- DOJ conclusions: "no credible evidence" of improper distribution

**The "Octopus" Connection:** Journalist Danny Casolaro investigated links between INSLAW, October Surprise, Iran-Contra, and BCCI; died under suspicious circumstances August 1991 (ruled suicide). Netflix documentary "American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders" (2024).

### Epstein Files Mishandling (2025)

**Background:** Epstein Files Transparency Act (November 2024) mandated DOJ release all Epstein-related documents by December 19, 2024.

**Key Failures:**
- Release fell "several hundred thousand pages" short of mandate
- Un-redacted survivor names published without privacy protections
- Sealed civil document with 20+ victim names posted publicly
- DOJ violated federal victim privacy requirements

**Bipartisan Response:**
- Reps. Massie (R) and Khanna (D) launched "inherent contempt" push against AG Bondi
- 12 senators called for DOJ handling audit
- DOJ statement criticized as reading "as if it's from Trump's personal lawyer"

**Historical Context (2007):** U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta approved controversial non-prosecution agreement allowing Epstein state guilty plea while avoiding federal sex trafficking charges. Acosta resigned as Secretary of Labor (2019) over case handling.

### Politicized Prosecutions (2025)

**Comey/James Case Dismissals:**

> Federal judge dismissed indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and NY Attorney General Letitia James, finding prosecutor Lindsey Halligan (Trump's personal lawyer) was unlawfully appointed.
>
> — [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-dismisses-cases-james-comey-letitia-james-finding-prosecutor-was-rcna244775)

**Procedural Violations:**
- Halligan had no prosecutorial experience
- Failed to present final indictment to grand jury
- Grand jurors never reviewed or voted on actual charges
- Career EDVA prosecutors strongly objected

**Career Prosecutor Exodus:**
- 100+ DOJ prosecutors and lawyers resigned since January 2025
- Many cited political interference, pressure to drop cases
- Public Integrity Unit reduced from 36 lawyers to 2
- Bribery probe into "border czar" Tom Homan reportedly shut down

**FBI Personnel Purge:**
- All attorneys prosecuting January 6 and Mar-a-Lago cases fired within two weeks
- Demand for names of FBI agents who worked Trump investigations
- FBI agents sued to block release of personnel lists

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding INSLAW/PROMIS:** The bankruptcy court's finding of DOJ "trickery, fraud and deceit" in acquiring Inslaw's software—combined with allegations of global distribution with surveillance backdoors—represents one of the most troubling documented cases of potential government misconduct. That the FBI eventually classified it as a "Major Case" comparable to bin Laden and 9/11 suggests institutional recognition of significance despite official DOJ denials.

**Regarding Prosecutorial Independence:** The 2025 events—appointment of Trump's personal lawyer as prosecutor, mass resignation of career attorneys, dismantling of Public Integrity Unit—represent a fundamental challenge to post-Watergate norms of prosecutorial independence. Former White House Ethics Counsel Richard Painter's warning about descent into "Putin's Russia" style justice reflects serious institutional concerns.

**Regarding Epstein Files:** The combination of incomplete disclosure, victim privacy violations, and politically-charged DOJ statements suggests the department struggled to handle a politically sensitive matter with appropriate professionalism, regardless of which administration bears responsibility for historical failures.

**Regarding FBI Integration:** The FBI's position within DOJ creates permanent tension between law enforcement and political accountability. The periodic politicization of FBI investigations—whether targeting political opponents or protecting allies—reflects structural vulnerabilities in this arrangement.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might assess this agency's role differently:

1. **Rule of Law Institutionalist View:** DOJ represents essential infrastructure for constitutional governance; attacks on prosecutorial independence undermine the foundation of equal justice and invite authoritarian abuses.

2. **Executive Power View:** The Attorney General serves at the President's pleasure; DOJ properly implements presidential priorities, and claims of "politicization" often reflect partisan disagreement with legitimate policy choices.

3. **Civil Liberties Critique:** DOJ's national security powers—expanded post-9/11—create dangerous surveillance and prosecution capabilities that threaten constitutional rights, regardless of which party controls the executive.

4. **Institutional Reform Perspective:** Recurring scandals (INSLAW, IRS targeting, politicized prosecutions) suggest systemic accountability failures requiring structural reforms beyond personnel changes.

5. **Federalism Concern:** Federal criminal jurisdiction has expanded far beyond original constitutional boundaries, with DOJ enforcement discretion creating de facto national law enforcement authority the Founders never envisioned.
