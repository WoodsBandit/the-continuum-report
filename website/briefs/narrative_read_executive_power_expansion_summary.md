## The Core Question

The men who threw tea into Boston Harbor revolted over a three percent tax imposed without consent. Today, the federal government takes twelve to thirty-seven percent of income before workers ever see it — automatically, through "withholding." How did we get here?

This is not conspiracy. It's documented history, traceable through court decisions, statutes, executive orders, and constitutional amendments.

## The Timeline

### 1895: The Constitution Said No

In *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.*, the Supreme Court struck down the federal income tax as unconstitutional. Direct taxes required apportionment among states by population — a structural barrier the Founders installed deliberately. The Court confirmed the Constitution meant what it said.

### 1913: The Year Everything Changed

Two transformations in a single year:

- **The 16th Amendment** removed the apportionment requirement, enabling unapportioned income taxation
- **The Federal Reserve Act** created central banking authority over currency and credit

The Pujo Committee had just exposed concentrated banking power in the "Money Trust." Congress responded by creating a new institution with enormous financial power.

### 1917-1933: Emergency Powers Never End

The **Trading with the Enemy Act** (1917) granted wartime presidential authority over economic transactions. It remained on the books after WWI ended.

In 1933, FDR used this wartime statute to justify peacetime bank closures. Congress amended it to apply "during any period of national emergency declared by the President."

**Executive Order 6102** (April 1933) ordered American citizens to surrender gold at $20.67/oz. The government then revalued to $35/oz — a 69% markup. The "emergency" lasted 41 years.

### 1952: A Rare Judicial Check

In *Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer*, the Supreme Court blocked Truman's seizure of steel mills during Korea. Justice Jackson's concurrence established the framework: when Congress says no, the President cannot act.

A genuine limit — but Congress would increasingly authorize what *Youngstown* seemed to prohibit.

### 1971: Nixon Shock

On August 15, Nixon unilaterally closed the gold window, ending dollar-gold convertibility. No vote. No amendment. Just an announcement. The "temporary suspension" became permanent. Americans who surrendered gold in 1933 on the promise of gold-backed dollars watched that promise evaporate.

### 1976-1977: Codifying the Emergency State

The **National Emergencies Act** was meant to limit emergency powers. Instead, it regularized them. The **International Emergency Economic Powers Act** gave presidents vast authority whenever they declare an "unusual and extraordinary threat."

Today, over 40 national emergencies remain active, some decades old.

### 1946-2024: The Administrative Fourth Branch

The **Administrative Procedure Act** (1946) established regulatory agency procedures. **Chevron** (1984) told courts to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Agencies came to write most rules governing daily life.

**Loper Bright** (2024) overturned Chevron — a rare ratchet turning backward.

### 1978-2001: Surveillance as Governance

**FISA** (1978) created secret courts for surveillance warrants. The **PATRIOT Act** (2001) massively expanded authorities. The government that couldn't impose an income tax in 1895 now claims authority to collect records of virtually every phone call.

---

## The Pattern

Each expansion follows the same logic:

1. **Crisis** creates demand for government action
2. **Authority** is granted, often "temporarily"
3. **Crisis passes** but authority persists
4. **The ratchet turns one direction**

This is not partisan. FDR confiscated gold. Nixon closed the gold window. Both parties expand executive power when they hold it and complain when they don't.

## The Question

The Constitution still exists. The text hasn't changed much. But its practical meaning has been transformed by amendments, statutes, executive orders, judicial deference, and administrative expansion.

The tea was three percent.

What percentage are you paying now?
