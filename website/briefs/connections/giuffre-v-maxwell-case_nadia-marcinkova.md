## The Documented Record

**The following contains only direct quotes and factual citations. No interpretation.**

### Discovery Request References

**[ECF Doc. 1327-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1327-12.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24:

Giuffre's discovery requests sought:

> "all communications with thirteen specific witnesses, namely Jeffrey Epstein, Virginia Roberts, Prince Andrew, Ross Gow, Alan Dershowitz, Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Glenn and Eva Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcincova and Bill and Hillary Clinton."

Marcinkova was one of thirteen specifically named individuals for whom Giuffre requested Maxwell's communications.

### Deposition and Fifth Amendment Invocation

**[ECF Doc. 1331-13](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-13.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24, p. 15:

> "Ms. Giuffre took the depositions of Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova. Again, they both took the Fifth on all substantive questions."

Marcinkova was deposed in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* litigation and invoked Fifth Amendment privileges.

### Sarah Ransome Affidavit References

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24, p. 2:

The Ransome affidavit, filed as an exhibit in *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, contains allegations regarding Marcinkova's presence during sexual activities. Ransome was 22 (an adult) at the time of the events she describes.

### Co-Conspirator Designation

Court documents reference Marcinkova as one of four individuals designated as unindicted co-conspirators in the 2008 federal non-prosecution agreement, alongside Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, and Lesley Groff.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding Marcinkova's role in the litigation:** In our assessment, Marcinkova was a significant witness in *Giuffre v. Maxwell*. Her deposition was taken, though she invoked Fifth Amendment privileges on substantive questions, limiting the information obtained.

**Regarding the Ransome affidavit:** The affidavit filed by Sarah Ransome contains specific allegations regarding Marcinkova. We note that Ransome was an adult at the time of the events she describes. These are allegations from one affiant that have not been tested through cross-examination.

**Regarding potential victimization:** The documents do not establish whether Marcinkova herself may have been a victim of exploitation. Earlier media reports—not in the court documents—have referenced allegations that Epstein brought Marcinkova from Eastern Europe at a young age. This raises questions about agency that complicate characterizations of her role.

**Regarding the Fifth Amendment:** Marcinkova's invocation of Fifth Amendment privileges is a constitutionally protected right that may be exercised for many reasons. It does not establish facts and should not be interpreted as an admission.

**Our editorial judgment:** The *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case produced significant documentary references to Marcinkova, including deposition (invoking Fifth Amendment) and third-party allegations. The record raises questions we cannot answer about her role—whether participant, victim, or both.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Fifth Amendment invocations are not admissions.** Lawyers routinely advise clients to invoke these protections regardless of actual culpability.

2. **Marcinkova may be a trafficking victim.** If she was brought to the United States by Epstein at a young age, her circumstances may resist simple characterization.

3. **The Ransome affidavit is one person's account** that has not been tested in adversarial proceedings.

4. **The absence of charges is significant.** Despite the co-conspirator designation, federal prosecutors have not charged Marcinkova, which may reflect recognition of victim status, cooperation, or evidentiary limitations.

5. **The documentary record is incomplete** regarding Marcinkova's own experiences and perspective.
