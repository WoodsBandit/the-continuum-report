### Note on Documentary Scope

The analyzed documents contain attorney questions about whether individuals were sent to provide massages to Dubin, but do not contain testimony establishing any connection between Dubin and Epstein beyond social acquaintance through the Dubin family's friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The Dubin-Epstein connection in the documentary record is minimal:

**Thin evidentiary basis:** The substantive content regarding a Dubin-Epstein relationship consists primarily of attorney questions (which are not evidence) and a Fifth Amendment invocation by Marcinkova (which establishes nothing about Dubin).

**No direct allegations:** We find no testimony from any witness stating that Dubin and Epstein had a relationship beyond social acquaintance, or that Dubin engaged in any misconduct related to Epstein.

**Attorney questions not evidence:** Lawyers ask questions to explore possibilities; the questions themselves do not establish that the conduct inquired about occurred or that the relationships implied existed in the manner suggested.

In our assessment, the documentary record does not support characterizing a significant Dubin-Epstein relationship based on the analyzed documents.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Attorney questions are exploratory:** Questions posed in depositions reflect counsel's investigation strategy, not established facts about the subjects.

2. **Fifth Amendment irrelevant to Dubin:** Marcinkova's invocation of Fifth Amendment rights when asked about Dubin tells us about Marcinkova's legal strategy, not about Dubin or any Dubin-Epstein relationship.

3. **Absence of evidence:** The absence of substantive testimony about a Dubin-Epstein relationship may indicate such relationship was not material to the litigation.

4. **Social circle overlap:** Both Dubin and Epstein moved in New York financial circles, which may account for any social acquaintance without implying deeper involvement.

5. **Never charged:** Glenn Dubin has never been charged with any crime, and no direct allegations appear in the analyzed documents.
