## The Documented Record

**The following contains only factual citations from historical records. No interpretation.**

### Meyer Lansky Background

Meyer Lansky (1902-1983), born Maier Suchowljansky, was a major organized crime figure who operated primarily from the 1920s through the 1970s. Known as the "Mob's Accountant," Lansky was instrumental in the development of the National Crime Syndicate and operated gambling operations in Cuba, Las Vegas, and elsewhere.

- Never convicted of anything more serious than illegal gambling
- Attempted to emigrate to Israel in 1970; returned to U.S. in 1972
- Died in Miami Beach, Florida, January 15, 1983

### Roy Cohn Background

Roy Marcus Cohn (1927-1986) was an American lawyer who served as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy hearings. After leaving government service, Cohn became a prominent New York attorney representing a clientele that included organized crime figures.

- Chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy (1953-1954)
- Disbarred in New York in 1986 for unethical conduct
- Died August 2, 1986, in Bethesda, Maryland

### New York City Overlap

Both figures operated within New York City during overlapping periods from the 1950s through the early 1980s. Cohn's law practice included representation of organized crime clients, and he was known to operate within social circles that intersected with organized crime networks.

### Cohn's Organized Crime Clients

Roy Cohn represented multiple organized crime figures during his legal career, including:
- Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno (Genovese crime family boss)
- Carmine Galante (Bonanno crime family)
- John Gotti (Gambino crime family)

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The connection between Meyer Lansky and Roy Cohn represents an intersection of organized crime and political-legal power structures in mid-20th century New York. While direct personal interaction between the two is not extensively documented in the public record, both operated within overlapping social and criminal networks.

Cohn's documented representation of major organized crime figures places him within the legal infrastructure that served the National Crime Syndicate with which Lansky was associated. The question of whether Cohn ever directly represented Lansky or his interests remains a matter of historical research rather than established fact.

What is documented is that Cohn moved comfortably between worlds of political power (McCarthy hearings, later connections to political figures) and organized crime (his extensive Mafia clientele). Lansky similarly operated at the intersection of criminal enterprise and legitimate business, with documented connections to political figures in multiple jurisdictions.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **No direct connection:** The two may have operated in overlapping spheres without direct personal or professional interaction.

2. **Separate networks:** Lansky's primarily Jewish organized crime network and Cohn's Italian Mafia clientele may have represented distinct, non-overlapping circles.

3. **Temporal limitations:** By the time Cohn's organized crime practice was most active (1970s-80s), Lansky was largely retired and residing in Miami.

4. **Circumstantial overlap:** New York's concentrated power structure may have created apparent connections that were merely coincidental proximity.
