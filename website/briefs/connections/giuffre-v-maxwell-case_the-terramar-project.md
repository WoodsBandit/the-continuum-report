## The Documented Record

**The following contains only direct quotes and factual citations. No interpretation.**

### Terramar Project Background

The Terramar Project was an ocean conservation nonprofit founded by Ghislaine Maxwell in 2012. The organization:

- Focused on ocean conservation and sustainability
- Operated until 2019
- Was dissolved following Jeffrey Epstein's July 2019 arrest

### References in Giuffre v. Maxwell

The *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case documents we reviewed do not contain extensive direct references to the Terramar Project specifically. The case focused on Giuffre's allegations of trafficking and Maxwell's alleged role in recruitment and grooming during the periods relevant to Giuffre's claims (late 1990s to early 2000s).

Terramar was founded approximately a decade after the events underlying Giuffre's allegations.

### Maxwell's Public Profile

Maxwell's role as Terramar's founder and public advocate contributed to her public profile during the period when *Giuffre v. Maxwell* was litigated (2015-2017). Media coverage of the litigation included references to Maxwell's then-current activities, including Terramar.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the connection type:** In our assessment, the connection between *Giuffre v. Maxwell* and the Terramar Project is indirect and interpretive. Terramar was Maxwell's organization during the litigation period, but the case itself focused on events predating Terramar's existence.

**Regarding public perception:** The juxtaposition of Maxwell's public persona as an ocean conservationist with the allegations in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* created significant media coverage. This contrast became part of the public narrative surrounding the case.

**Regarding Terramar's dissolution:** Terramar dissolved in 2019 following Epstein's arrest. This timing suggests the organization could not survive the renewed scrutiny of Maxwell's alleged activities, though no allegations of wrongdoing involve Terramar itself.

**Regarding allegations against Terramar:** We found no allegations in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* documents that Terramar was involved in any illegal activity. The organization appears to have been a legitimate nonprofit that dissolved due to reputational damage to its founder.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Terramar-*Giuffre v. Maxwell* connection is contextual rather than substantive. Terramar represents Maxwell's public persona during the litigation period, but the case documents focus on earlier events. No evidence suggests Terramar was involved in the conduct alleged in the lawsuit.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Terramar was a legitimate organization.** It focused on ocean conservation and appears to have engaged in genuine advocacy work unrelated to the allegations in *Giuffre v. Maxwell*.

2. **Temporal disconnect:** Terramar was founded in 2012; the events alleged in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* occurred primarily in the early 2000s or earlier.

3. **Dissolution reflects reputational damage, not wrongdoing.** Organizations often cannot survive when their founder faces serious allegations, regardless of the organization's own conduct.

4. **No allegations against Terramar:** The *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case documents do not allege that Terramar was involved in trafficking, recruitment, or any illegal activity.

5. **Inclusion is interpretive:** Connecting Terramar to the case reflects analytical framing of Maxwell's activities, not documentary evidence of organizational involvement in alleged misconduct.
