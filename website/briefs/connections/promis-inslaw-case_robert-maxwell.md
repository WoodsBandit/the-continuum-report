## The Documented Record

**The following contains only direct quotes and factual citations. No interpretation.**

### Congressional Investigation

House Judiciary Committee, "The INSLAW Affair" (September 1992):

The committee investigated allegations that the Department of Justice stole enhanced PROMIS software from INSLAW, Inc. and distributed it through unauthorized channels.

Key finding from the report: "Information obtained by the Hamiltons through sworn affidavits of several individuals, including Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli Mossad officer, and Michael Riconosciuto, indicated that one element of the Justice Department's malfeasance against INSLAW was the modification of the 'enhanced' PROMIS software."

### PROMIS Software Background

PROMIS (Prosecutor's Management Information System) was a sophisticated case management software developed by INSLAW, Inc. under a contract with the U.S. Department of Justice. The Hamiltons (INSLAW founders William and Nancy Hamilton) alleged the software was stolen and illegally distributed.

### Robert Maxwell Allegations

Sworn affidavits examined by the House Judiciary Committee included allegations that Robert Maxwell, the British media magnate, was involved in the international distribution of modified PROMIS software to foreign intelligence agencies.

### Robert Maxwell's Death

Robert Maxwell died November 5, 1991, after falling from his yacht off the Canary Islands. His death occurred during the period when congressional investigators were examining the INSLAW allegations.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The alleged connection between Robert Maxwell and the PROMIS software represents one of the more controversial threads in the INSLAW affair. Congressional investigation examined testimony suggesting Maxwell served as a distribution channel for modified PROMIS software to foreign governments.

We observe that the allegations against Maxwell emerged from sworn affidavits rather than documented transactions. The evidentiary foundation rests primarily on the testimony of individuals like Ari Ben-Menashe and Michael Riconosciuto, whose credibility has been both defended and challenged.

Robert Maxwell's established media empire and documented connections to multiple governments provided the infrastructure that witnesses alleged was used for PROMIS distribution. However, Maxwell died before he could respond to these allegations in any official proceeding.

The INSLAW affair remains officially unresolved. The House Judiciary Committee found the allegations credible enough to warrant investigation but could not compel conclusive documentation.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Witness credibility:** Key witnesses making allegations against Maxwell have been challenged on credibility grounds; their testimony may not reflect actual events.

2. **Posthumous allegations:** Maxwell died before responding to PROMIS allegations; he cannot defend against claims made after his death.

3. **No direct documentation:** Allegations rest on testimony rather than documented transactions or communications.

4. **Political context:** The INSLAW affair occurred during a period of intense political controversy; allegations may reflect partisan disputes rather than documented misconduct.
