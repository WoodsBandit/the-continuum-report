## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The documentary record establishes Sarah Kellen as Jeffrey Epstein's assistant and scheduler. She was designated an unindicted co-conspirator in Epstein's 2008 federal non-prosecution agreement alongside Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and Nadia Marcinkova.

Kellen was named as a defendant in multiple civil lawsuits related to Epstein's activities, indicating plaintiffs believed she played a role beyond standard administrative functions. She invoked Fifth Amendment privileges during civil depositions.

We observe that the co-conspirator designation did not result in criminal charges. The reasons for the designation, and the decision not to charge her, are not explained in the documents we reviewed. This may reflect: cooperation with investigators, insufficient evidence for charges, prosecutorial discretion, the terms of the NPA itself, or other factors.

The documents do not establish the specific nature of Kellen's knowledge, duties, or state of mind. Her own account is absent due to Fifth Amendment invocations.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Administrative role:** Employment as a scheduler does not establish criminal knowledge. Many assistants perform duties without awareness of their employer's illegal activities.

2. **Co-conspirator technicality:** "Unindicted co-conspirator" is a legal term that can be applied broadly based on proximity. The absence of charges may indicate prosecutors did not believe charges were warranted.

3. **Fifth Amendment protection:** Invocations are constitutionally protected rights that lawyers routinely advise, regardless of actual culpability.

4. **Potential victim:** The documents do not address whether Kellen herself may have been recruited, groomed, or coerced during her employment with Epstein.
