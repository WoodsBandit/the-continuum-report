## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the nature of references:** In our assessment, Glenn Dubin's appearance in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* documentary record reflects his status as a known associate of Jeffrey Epstein. This social connection made communications with him relevant to discovery.

**Regarding the absence of allegations:** We find no allegations in the documents we reviewed that Glenn Dubin engaged in any illegal activity. His inclusion in discovery requests appears to reflect network mapping rather than specific allegations against him.

**Regarding attorney questions:** Attorney questions in depositions may reference individuals without alleging wrongdoing. Questions are not evidence of the conduct asked about.

**Regarding the Dubin family's position:** The Dubins have not been charged with any offense and, based on available information, are not known to be subjects of investigation. Their appearance in discovery reflects association with Epstein, not allegations of participation in criminal conduct.

**Our editorial judgment:** The *Giuffre v. Maxwell* connection to Glenn Dubin is documentary and thin. The case sought information about Maxwell's communications with him, but this reflects discovery practice rather than substantive allegations. We find no basis for characterizing Glenn Dubin as a participant in any wrongdoing based on the documents reviewed.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Social connection is not culpability.** Many individuals maintained social or business relationships with Jeffrey Epstein without knowledge of or participation in his crimes.

2. **Discovery casts a wide net.** Attorneys routinely seek communications with individuals who may have relevant information, including individuals not accused of wrongdoing.

3. **Attorney questions are not allegations.** Questions posed during depositions do not constitute allegations of fact.

4. **No charges or public allegations.** Glenn Dubin has not been criminally charged or publicly accused of illegal activity in connection with Epstein.

5. **The documentary record is limited.** The references to Glenn Dubin in the case materials are sparse and do not support conclusions about his conduct.
