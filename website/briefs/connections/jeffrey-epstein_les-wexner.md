## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The Wexner-Epstein relationship represents one of the most unusual financial arrangements in modern business history. A billionaire founder of a major retail empire granted sweeping power of attorney to an individual with limited documented financial background.

We observe that Wexner claims victim status regarding financial misappropriation. His 2019 statement expressed surprise at Epstein's conduct. The 2007 severance date preceded Epstein's 2008 Florida guilty plea but came during the investigation period.

In our assessment, the relationship raises unanswered questions about due diligence, the property transfer circumstances, and the extent of Wexner's knowledge prior to 2007. However, Wexner has never been charged with any crime and denies knowledge of Epstein's criminal conduct.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Victim interpretation:** Wexner was a victim of Epstein's manipulation and financial fraud, as his representatives have stated.

2. **Willful blindness:** Wexner may have avoided asking questions about Epstein's conduct or income sources without having direct knowledge.

3. **Pure business:** The relationship was purely financial, and Wexner had no exposure to Epstein's criminal conduct.

4. **Sophisticated deception:** Even sophisticated individuals can be deceived by skilled manipulators.
