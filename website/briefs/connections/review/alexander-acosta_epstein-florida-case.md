### Source: DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility Report (November 2020)

The DOJ OPR investigated the conduct of Acosta and other prosecutors in negotiating the 2008 NPA. Key findings:

- Acosta and other prosecutors exercised "poor judgment" in several aspects of the plea agreement
- The prosecutors did not commit professional misconduct
- The prosecutors did not violate any laws
- The investigation did not find grounds for disciplinary action

### Source: 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (2021)

The Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed Judge Marra's CVRA ruling. The appellate court held that CVRA rights do not attach until formal charges are filed. Because federal charges were never filed against Epstein, the court found no CVRA violation occurred.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, Alexander Acosta's connection to the Epstein Florida Case is foundational to understanding what many characterize as a prosecutorial failure of historic proportions. As U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009, Acosta's office had ultimate authority over the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and negotiated the controversial 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement.

**Regarding the NPA terms:** Based on our review, the agreement negotiated under Acosta's leadership contained provisions that appear, in our view, extraordinarily favorable to a defendant facing allegations of serial sexual abuse of minors: (1) immunity from federal prosecution; (2) immunity for unnamed "potential co-conspirators"; (3) state charges of solicitation of prostitution rather than federal sex trafficking; (4) approximately 13 months in county jail with work release privileges; and (5) secrecy from identified victims until after finalization.

**Regarding the CVRA proceedings:** Judge Marra's 2019 finding that Acosta's office violated victims' rights by concealing the NPA suggests, in our interpretation, a deliberate strategy to exclude victims from a process in which they had statutory interests. The imagery of prosecutors spending "untold hours" with defense counsel while telling victims to be "patient" is, in our editorial judgment, a damning characterization of the process.

**Regarding the OPR findings:** We interpret the "poor judgment" finding as institutional acknowledgment that the NPA process was deficient, while the absence of professional misconduct findings reflects the broad discretion afforded to prosecutors. In our view, the distinction between "poor judgment" and "misconduct" may have more to do with the standards for disciplinary action than with the quality of the prosecutorial decisions.

**Regarding Acosta's resignation:** The timing of Acosta's July 2019 resignation as Labor Secretary—days after Epstein's arrest on new federal charges in New York—suggests, in our assessment, that the political consequences of the 2008 NPA had finally materialized. The eleven-year gap between the agreement and substantive accountability raises questions about oversight of consequential prosecutorial decisions.

**Central role in narrative:** In our view, Acosta occupies a central position in the prosecutorial failure narrative surrounding the Epstein case. The question of why a federal prosecutor's office would grant such favorable terms to a defendant facing serious allegations, protect unnamed co-conspirators, and conceal the agreement from victims remains, in our assessment, inadequately explained by Acosta's public statements about trial risks and evidentiary challenges.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **Legitimate prosecutorial discretion:** Acosta may have made reasonable professional judgments about evidence quality, trial risks, and witness cooperation. Sex trafficking cases in 2008 faced evidentiary challenges that may have informed the decision to accept state charges over uncertain federal prosecution.

2. **OPR exoneration:** The Office of Professional Responsibility explicitly found no professional misconduct and no legal violations. The "poor judgment" finding stops well short of condemning Acosta's conduct as improper. Prosecutorial decisions are often criticized in hindsight without constituting misconduct.

3. **11th Circuit reversal:** The en banc reversal of Judge Marra's CVRA ruling undermines claims that Acosta violated victims' legal rights. The appellate court found that CVRA rights do not attach until formal charges are filed—charges that were never brought.

4. **Genuine trial risks:** The 2008 case involved minor witnesses who might have been reluctant to testify publicly, potential impeachment issues, and a defendant with extraordinary legal resources. Acosta's concern that state prosecution alone might have resulted in less jail time reflects legitimate prosecutorial calculation.

5. **Different evidence in 2019:** The SDNY charges against Epstein in 2019 may have been supported by evidence not available or fully developed in 2008. Years of investigative journalism and additional victim cooperation may have strengthened the case in ways not possible a decade earlier.

6. **Political timing of scrutiny:** Acosta's nomination to the Trump administration in 2017 brought renewed attention to a decade-old decision. Some criticism may have been politically motivated rather than based solely on prosecutorial merits.

7. **Institutional rather than individual failure:** The NPA involved multiple prosecutors and levels of approval within the U.S. Attorney's office. Focusing on Acosta individually may obscure systemic factors that enabled the agreement.

## Methodology Note

This connection brief was generated by analyzing court filings from *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, Case No. 15-cv-07433 (S.D.N.Y.), judicial rulings from *Jane Doe #1 and #2 v. United States*, Case No. 08-cv-80736 (S.D. Fla.), and the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility Report (November 2020). Direct quotes are extracted verbatim from unsealed documents and public rulings. Editorial analysis sections represent protected opinion under First Amendment precedent established in *Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1 (1990).

**Legal/Criminal Context:** Alexander Acosta has never been criminally charged. The DOJ OPR found "poor judgment" but no professional misconduct. Judge Marra's 2019 CVRA ruling was reversed by the 11th Circuit en banc in 2021. Acosta resigned as Secretary of Labor on July 19, 2019, following renewed scrutiny after Epstein's arrest on federal charges in New York. Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody on August 10, 2019.
