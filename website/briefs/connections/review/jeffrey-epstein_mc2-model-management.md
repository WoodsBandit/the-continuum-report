> "Epstein invested $1 million in the agency."
>
> — Maritza Vasquez, former MC2 bookkeeper (2003-2006), 2010 sworn deposition

Vasquez confirmed the payment from her direct access to the agency's financial records as bookkeeper. The payment occurred in 2004-2005 to launch MC2 Model Management.

### Source: U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida — Civil Complaint

> "Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, and others deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money."

> — Maritza Vasquez, former MC2 bookkeeper, 2010 sworn deposition

The address 301 East 66th Street, New York, was home for years to young models associated with the agency, giving Epstein direct access to vulnerable young women under the guise of professional accommodation.

### Source: U.S. District Court Filing — Recruitment Allegations

> "[Brunel would] bring girls as young as 12 to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein."

> — Court documents, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida

### Source: Virginia Giuffre Deposition (2016, made public 2019)

> "[Epstein told her he had] slept with over 1,000 of Brunel's girls."
>
> — Virginia Giuffre, 2016 deposition (made public 2019)

Giuffre also stated in her 2015 affidavit that Epstein bragged about this figure. She told NBC's "Dateline" in 2019 that Epstein said he had "slept with over a thousand women that Brunel brought in."

### Source: Court Documents — Visa and Housing Scheme

> "Epstein and Brunel brought underage girls from all over the world, promising them modeling contracts. Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls; they would charge the underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in the condos."
>
> — Court documents filed in U.S. District Court

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, Epstein's relationship with MC2 Model Management represents one of the most significant documented examples of how legitimate business infrastructure was allegedly exploited for trafficking purposes. The financial investment of $1-2 million, combined with the housing arrangements and visa facilitation, suggests, in our view, a carefully structured operational relationship rather than a passive investment.

We interpret the naming of the agency as particularly revealing. The name "MC2" references Einstein's equation E=mc2, with the "E" reportedly representing Epstein — a symbolic branding of his ownership and control over the enterprise. This suggests Epstein viewed MC2 not merely as an investment but as an extension of his operations.

Based on our review, the infrastructure Epstein provided to MC2 created multiple points of control over vulnerable young women:

1. **Financial dependency**: Epstein's $1-2 million capitalized the agency, making Brunel operationally dependent on Epstein.

2. **Housing control**: Models housed in Epstein-controlled apartments at 301 East 66th Street were, in our assessment, placed directly within Epstein's sphere of access.

3. **Immigration dependency**: The documented visa sponsorship arrangements meant foreign models were legally dependent on agency-related entities for their immigration status.

4. **Economic trap**: The practice of charging models rent while controlling their housing and visa status created, in our view, a form of debt bondage.

The documentary record suggests MC2 functioned as more than a modeling agency. Major retail clients including Nordstrom, Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, JCPenney, Kohl's, Target, Sears, and Belk provided legitimate business revenue that, in our assessment, served as cover for the alleged trafficking operation. By 2014, Brunel's business partner Jeff Fuller received what he described as "tremendous amount of worries from our clients" about ties to Epstein.

In our view, the geographic structure of MC2 — with offices in New York City, Miami, and Tel Aviv — aligned with Epstein's property holdings and known travel patterns. The Miami office opened in 2005, strategically close to Palm Beach where extensive abuse was later documented.

The dissolution timeline is also notable. MC2 officially dissolved on September 27, 2019, approximately six weeks after Epstein's death in August 2019. In our assessment, this rapid dissolution, combined with the hasty sale of MC2 Miami assets to The Source Models (run by MC2 executives), suggests an effort to distance operations from the Epstein scandal.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **Legitimate Investment Thesis:** Epstein's $1-2 million investment could be viewed as a standard business investment in a legitimate modeling agency. Wealthy individuals frequently invest in entertainment and fashion ventures without operational involvement in illegal activities.

2. **Business Relationship vs. Criminal Conspiracy:** The housing of models in Epstein-controlled apartments might reflect ordinary real estate arrangements in New York's expensive housing market rather than evidence of a trafficking scheme. Modeling agencies routinely arrange housing for models.

3. **Knowledge Limitations:** Brunel's lawsuit against Epstein in 2015, claiming lost business and obstruction of justice, could suggest that Brunel himself was unaware of or victimized by Epstein's criminal activities, rather than being a willing co-conspirator.

4. **Retrospective Interpretation Bias:** Court filings and allegations, while serious, represent one side of contested legal disputes. Many claims in civil litigation are never proven and may reflect litigation strategy rather than established facts.

5. **Symbolic Naming Skepticism:** The interpretation of "MC2" as representing Epstein's ownership (with "E" standing for Epstein) may be speculative inference rather than documented fact. The name could simply reflect industry branding conventions without deeper meaning.

6. **Magnitude of Claims:** The assertion that Epstein claimed to have "slept with over 1,000 of Brunel's girls" relies on secondhand reporting of Epstein's alleged statements. Such extraordinary claims may reflect exaggeration, misunderstanding, or strategic litigation positioning.
