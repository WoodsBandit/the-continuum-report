### Context: Maria Farmer Allegations

According to public statements and court-referenced accounts:

- Maria Farmer alleged she was assaulted by both Epstein and Maxwell at Les Wexner's Ohio property in May 1996
- Maxwell's presence at Wexner properties is documented through victim accounts
- This places Maxwell at Wexner-connected locations during the period of alleged criminal activity

### Context: The Epstein-Wexner Financial Relationship

The connection between Maxwell and Wexner was mediated through Jeffrey Epstein:

- Epstein managed Wexner's finances from the late 1980s until 2007
- Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney over his financial affairs
- Maxwell was Epstein's longtime associate (1992-2009 by her own deposition admission)
- Both Maxwell and Wexner had access to Epstein's properties and social network

### Context: FBI Co-Conspirator Identification (July 2019)

Per DOJ email release (House Oversight Congressional Disclosure):

- FBI New York office email (July 2019) identified "10 co-conspirators" in the Epstein case
- Les Wexner was specifically named as a co-conspirator
- Described as "wealthy business man in Ohio"
- No charges were filed against Wexner
- Wexner's lawyer later claimed Wexner was "cleared" though no FBI documentation of such "clearing" exists in public record

**Note:** Being identified as a co-conspirator in an FBI email does not constitute a finding of guilt or an allegation of crime. No charges were filed.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, the documentary record establishes that Ghislaine Maxwell and Les Wexner were connected through their respective relationships with Jeffrey Epstein rather than through an independent personal or business relationship. Maxwell confirmed under oath that she "knows" Wexner, while categorically denying specific allegations regarding providing clothing for him.

We interpret the inclusion of "Wexner" as a discovery search term in the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation as indicating that plaintiff's counsel believed the Wexner connection was relevant to understanding Maxwell's activities. The specific question about providing "an outfit of a sexual nature" suggests allegations were made, though Maxwell's denial is part of the evidentiary record.

The Maria Farmer allegations place Maxwell at Wexner-connected property during an alleged assault in 1996. In our view, this establishes that Maxwell had access to Wexner's properties through her relationship with Epstein, though it does not establish that Wexner had knowledge of what occurred there.

We observe that the FBI's July 2019 identification of Wexner as one of ten co-conspirators raises significant questions. However, we also note that no charges were filed against Wexner, and the identification in an internal email does not constitute a formal allegation or finding of wrongdoing.

Based on our review, the Maxwell-Wexner connection appears to be a function of network proximity through Epstein rather than a direct collaborative relationship. Both individuals operated within Epstein's orbit during overlapping time periods, with Maxwell as Epstein's closest associate and Wexner as his primary financial benefactor.

**Important caveat:** Neither Maxwell nor any prosecution has alleged that Wexner participated in or had knowledge of criminal activity. Wexner has never been charged with any crime.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **Purely Incidental Overlap:** Maxwell and Wexner may have encountered each other only through Epstein-related social events without any meaningful independent relationship. Wealthy social circles often overlap without implying close personal relationships or shared knowledge.

2. **Property Access Through Epstein:** Maxwell's documented presence at Wexner properties may reflect Epstein's access as Wexner's financial manager rather than any direct relationship with or knowledge by Wexner. Property owners are not necessarily aware of all activities that occur on their properties when managed by others.

3. **Categorical Denial Weight:** Maxwell's emphatic denial ("categorically no") regarding the clothing allegation should be given weight as sworn testimony, absent contradicting evidence.

4. **No Direct Communications:** Maxwell testified she has not communicated with Wexner about the case, suggesting distance between the parties rather than coordination.

5. **FBI Email Context:** The FBI co-conspirator email may reflect investigative leads rather than established facts. The absence of subsequent charges against Wexner suggests investigators did not find sufficient evidence to proceed.

6. **Victim of Shared Association:** Wexner may himself be a victim of Epstein's manipulation, as his 2019 public statement claimed. The connection to Maxwell may be entirely through Epstein's deception of both parties.
