### Source: ECF 1320-28 — Freeh Report Rebuttal

> "Former FBI Director Louis Freeh submitted a report wherein he concluded that President Clinton 'did not, in fact travel to, nor was he present on, Little St. James Island between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2003.' Further, if any Secret Service agents had accompanied Clinton to that location, 'they would have been required to make and file shift logs, travel vouchers, and related documentation relating to the visit,' and there was a 'total absence' of any such documentation."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The Clinton-Epstein connection in the documentary record presents a notably balanced picture:

**Social acquaintance documented:** Court exhibits establish that Clinton and Epstein were socially acquainted, with references to travel together including the Africa trip with Kevin Spacey.

**Island visit disputed:** Giuffre claimed Clinton visited Epstein's island; the Louis Freeh report submitted by Maxwell's defense concluded Clinton was not present on the island during the relevant period, supported by the absence of required Secret Service documentation.

**No misconduct allegations:** Critically, Giuffre herself acknowledged making "no allegations of illegal actions by Bill Clinton." This distinguishes the Clinton references from allegations made against other individuals in the litigation.

In our assessment, the documentary record regarding Clinton consists primarily of contested claims about his presence at specific locations, with significant exculpatory evidence presented.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Freeh report dispositive:** A former FBI Director's investigation finding no evidence Clinton visited the island, combined with absent Secret Service records, may fully resolve the factual question.

2. **Charitable context:** The Africa trip references appear to describe charitable work rather than travel to Epstein's Caribbean properties.

3. **Media statements vs. sworn testimony:** Giuffre's media statements about Clinton were made outside sworn testimony and were vigorously disputed.

4. **No allegations acknowledged:** Giuffre's own acknowledgment that she made no allegations of illegal actions by Clinton is significant exculpatory evidence.

5. **Social connection not criminal:** Knowing Epstein socially does not establish knowledge of or participation in illegal activity.
