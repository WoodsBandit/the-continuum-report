### USVI Complaint References to Deutsche Bank

The USVI v. JPMorgan complaint cited Deutsche Bank's regulatory action:

> "The New York State Department of Financial Services ('NYSDFS') investigated Deutsche Bank for failures to monitor Epstein's accounts. On July 6, 2020, the NYSDFS and Deutsche Bank entered into a Consent Order with a $150 million penalty."
>
> — USVI Complaint, Paragraph 71

### Sequential Timeline

| 2013 | Deutsche Bank accepts Epstein as client |

- Deutsche Bank case resulted in regulatory Consent Order with specific findings
- JP Morgan case involved civil litigation and settlement without regulatory action

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The connection between Deutsche Bank and the JP Morgan case is contextual—both banks maintained relationships with Epstein, but at different times. Deutsche Bank accepted Epstein after JP Morgan terminated him, suggesting Epstein sought alternative banking services after losing access to JP Morgan.

The USVI complaint referenced Deutsche Bank's regulatory penalty to illustrate that compliance failures regarding Epstein had already been documented. In our view, this reference established that the financial industry had notice of risks associated with Epstein accounts.

The two cases together demonstrate that Epstein maintained access to major financial institutions even after his 2008 conviction—JP Morgan until 2011, then Deutsche Bank from 2013 to 2018.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Separate matters:** JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank cases are legally distinct proceedings with different defendants.

2. **Regulatory vs. civil:** Deutsche Bank faced regulatory action; JP Morgan faced civil litigation—different processes with different standards.

3. **Timing:** Deutsche Bank's penalty came before the JP Morgan litigation, providing context rather than establishing connection.

4. **Industry-wide issues:** Both cases may reflect broader industry compliance problems rather than coordinated failures.
