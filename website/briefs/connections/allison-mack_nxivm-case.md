## The Documented Record

### Source: United States v. Keith Raniere, Case No. 18-CR-204 (E.D.N.Y.)

Allison Mack was arrested on April 20, 2018, in connection with the federal investigation of NXIVM. She was arrested at her residence in Brooklyn, New York.

The criminal complaint charged Mack with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy, and forced labor conspiracy. She was released on $5 million bond secured by her parents' property.

Mack was named as a co-defendant in the superseding indictment alongside Keith Raniere, Clare Bronfman, Nancy Salzman, Lauren Salzman, and Kathy Russell.

On April 8, 2019, Mack pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York before Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis.

In her plea allocution, Mack admitted to obtaining "collateral" from women she recruited into DOS and acknowledged that she knew her conduct was wrong. She expressed remorse for her actions.

Mack cooperated with federal prosecutors following her guilty plea. The extent and nature of her cooperation was documented in sentencing submissions.

On June 30, 2021, Judge Garaufis sentenced Mack to three years in federal prison. The sentence was below the federal sentencing guidelines range, reflecting Mack's cooperation, acceptance of responsibility, and demonstrated remorse.

Mack reported to FCI Dublin in California to begin serving her sentence. She was released from custody on July 10, 2023, having served approximately two years of her three-year sentence with credit for good behavior.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

Allison Mack's prosecution illustrates the challenges of holding mid-level participants accountable in hierarchical criminal organizations. As a "first-line master" in DOS, Mack occupied a position of authority over other women while remaining subordinate to Keith Raniere.

The three-year sentence imposed by Judge Garaufis represented a significant departure from the potential penalties Mack faced at arrest, reflecting multiple mitigating factors: her cooperation with prosecutors, her expressions of remorse, and her apparent recognition that she had been manipulated by Raniere while simultaneously victimizing others.

Mack's case attracted significant media attention due to her prior career as a television actress, raising broader questions about celebrity, manipulation, and accountability. Her public visibility may have made her case a focal point for discussions about how individuals become involved in exploitative organizations.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Appropriate Leniency**: The three-year sentence appropriately balanced Mack's culpability against her cooperation, remorse, and status as someone who was also manipulated by Raniere.

2. **Insufficient Accountability**: Given Mack's leadership role in DOS and her direct involvement in recruiting and controlling other women, the sentence was too lenient and failed to adequately address the harm caused to victims.

3. **Celebrity Treatment**: Mack's sentence may have been influenced by her celebrity status and the media attention on her case, resulting in different treatment than a non-celebrity defendant might have received.
