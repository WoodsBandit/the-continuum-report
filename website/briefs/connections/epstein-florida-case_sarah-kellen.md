> "the agreement between Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's office mentions people that are called co-conspirators of Epstein. And Leslie Groff is named as one of those co-conspirators."

### Source: ECF 1330-1 — NPA Terms

The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement protected named "co-conspirators" from federal prosecution:

> "the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida had concealed from Epstein's victims a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) that they had reached with Epstein."

The NPA protected "any potential co-conspirators" including those specifically named.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, Sarah Kellen's connection to the Epstein Florida Case is defined by her explicit designation as an "unindicted co-conspirator" in the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement.

**Regarding the co-conspirator designation:** Kellen was one of four individuals explicitly named as co-conspirators alongside Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and Nadia Marcinkova. This designation indicates prosecutors viewed these individuals as participants in the alleged conspiracy, yet the NPA shielded them from federal charges.

**Regarding the protection granted:** The NPA's blanket immunity for named co-conspirators meant that despite being explicitly identified as part of the alleged conspiracy, Kellen faced no federal prosecution. This immunity has persisted—Kellen has never been criminally charged.

**Regarding the designation without explanation:** The public record does not explain why prosecutors designated Kellen as a co-conspirator or why they agreed to immunity rather than prosecution. The evidentiary basis for the designation, and the decision-making behind the immunity grant, remain undisclosed.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Florida Case's connection to Kellen demonstrates the controversial scope of the NPA's immunity provisions. Explicit designation as a co-conspirator combined with blanket immunity raises significant questions about prosecutorial priorities.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Cooperation:** Kellen may have provided cooperation in exchange for immunity, with the co-conspirator designation reflecting that she had information prosecutors valued.

2. **Evidentiary limitations:** Prosecutors may have lacked sufficient evidence to prove charges against Kellen beyond reasonable doubt.

3. **Peripheral role:** The designation may reflect proximity to criminal activity rather than active participation.

4. **Victim considerations:** Kellen's own circumstances—whether she may have been exploited herself—are not documented in these records.

5. **Prosecutorial judgment:** Federal prosecutors may have made legitimate strategic decisions about whom to prioritize.
