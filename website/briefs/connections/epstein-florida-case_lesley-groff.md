## The Documented Record

**The following contains only direct quotes and factual citations. No interpretation.**

### Co-Conspirator Designation in NPA

**[ECF Doc. 1328-34](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-34.pdf)**, filed 01/05/24, pp. 11:11-16:

> "the agreement between Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's office mentions people that are called co-conspirators of Epstein. And Leslie Groff is named as one of those co-conspirators."

> "The other people mentioned as co-conspirators are Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, and Nadia Marcinkova."

### NPA Protections

The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida:

1. Protected Epstein from federal prosecution
2. Protected named "co-conspirators" from federal prosecution
3. Was concealed from victims (leading to CVRA litigation)

Lesley Groff, as a named co-conspirator, received immunity from federal prosecution under the NPA's terms.

### CVRA Case Context

The *Jane Doe #1 and #2 v. United States* litigation challenged the NPA on Crime Victims' Rights Act grounds. The case did not challenge the co-conspirator protections directly but addressed the government's failure to notify victims before finalizing the agreement.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the co-conspirator designation:** In our assessment, Lesley Groff's designation as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Epstein Florida case NPA is a significant legal fact. This designation meant she received federal immunity as part of Epstein's plea arrangement.

**Regarding what the designation does not establish:** The co-conspirator designation does not establish what specific conduct Groff allegedly engaged in or her level of knowledge about Epstein's activities. In federal practice, "unindicted co-conspirator" is a legal term that can be applied based on proximity without detailed findings.

**Regarding the absence of charges:** Despite the designation, Groff was never criminally charged. This may reflect: the NPA's immunity protections, evidentiary limitations, prosecutorial discretion, or recognition that the designation was broader than provable culpability.

**Regarding the thin documentary record:** Only 3-4 documents in the broader record directly reference Groff. The significance of her co-conspirator status cannot be fully assessed without substantially more information about her role and knowledge.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Epstein Florida Case-Groff connection is established through her co-conspirator designation in the NPA. This is a documented legal fact with significant implications—she received federal immunity—but the underlying basis for the designation and its accuracy remain unexplained in available documents.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Co-conspirator designation is a legal term**, not a finding of guilt. It can be applied based on proximity without establishing individual culpability.

2. **The NPA itself is controversial.** Designations made within a widely criticized agreement may not reflect careful prosecutorial assessment.

3. **Immunity may have been granted strategically.** Prosecutors sometimes grant immunity to peripheral figures to secure cooperation or simplify cases.

4. **Administrative employees are often included broadly.** Assistants may be named as co-conspirators based on their roles without assessment of individual knowledge.

5. **The absence of subsequent charges** across multiple jurisdictions and investigations may indicate that prosecutors who reviewed the matter did not find sufficient basis to charge Groff.
