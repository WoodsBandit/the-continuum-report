## The Documented Record

**The following contains only direct quotes and factual citations. No interpretation.**

### Source: ECF 1330-1 — NPA Co-Conspirator Protection

The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement protected not only Epstein but also unnamed "potential co-conspirators":

> "the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida had concealed from Epstein's victims a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) that they had reached with Epstein."

The NPA protected "any potential co-conspirators" from federal prosecution.

### Source: ECF 1331-4 — Maxwell's Call on Warrant Day

> Deposition testimony from housekeeper Louella Rabuyo dated October 20, 2009, indicated that Ghislaine Maxwell called the housekeeper on the day police executed the warrant and told her not to come in that morning.

### Source: ECF 1325-3 — Jane Doe Joinder Motion

The Jane Doe #3 and #4 joinder motion in the CVRA case contained extensive allegations about the trafficking operation that later formed the basis of Maxwell's criminal prosecution. While Maxwell was not named as a defendant in the Florida CVRA case, she was referenced in testimony and allegations.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, Maxwell's connection to the Epstein Florida Case is significant for two reasons: her apparent protection under the NPA's co-conspirator immunity, and testimony suggesting her awareness of the investigation.

**Regarding NPA protection:** While the NPA did not name Maxwell specifically, its blanket protection of "potential co-conspirators" appears to have shielded her from federal prosecution until 2020—over a decade later.

**Regarding the warrant-day call:** Testimony that Maxwell called the housekeeper on the morning of the search warrant execution, instructing her not to come in, suggests awareness of the investigation and potential coordination of responses.

**Regarding delayed accountability:** The NPA's co-conspirator protection meant that despite Maxwell's alleged central role in the trafficking operation, she faced no federal charges until July 2020—more than twelve years after the NPA was signed.

**Our editorial judgment:** The Florida Case's connection to Maxwell demonstrates how the NPA's broad immunity provisions may have enabled her to avoid accountability for over a decade.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **NPA interpretation:** Whether Maxwell was covered by NPA immunity was a legal question never fully adjudicated before her 2020 arrest.

2. **Warrant-day call:** Maxwell's call to the housekeeper may have had innocent explanations unrelated to the investigation.

3. **Investigation scope:** Federal prosecutors in 2008 may not have had sufficient evidence specifically implicating Maxwell.

4. **Subsequent prosecution:** Maxwell's 2020 arrest and 2021 conviction demonstrate the system eventually achieved accountability.

5. **Separate jurisdiction:** Maxwell's 2020 charges were brought in S.D.N.Y., not S.D. Florida, potentially avoiding NPA complications.
