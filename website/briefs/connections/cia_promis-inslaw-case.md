### Source: The INSLAW Affair — House Judiciary Committee Report (1992)

#### Software Theft Allegations

> "The Committee's investigation largely supports the findings of two federal court proceedings as well as the conclusions of numerous investigative journalists that the Department of Justice 'ichel' a data management system called PROMIS from a small computer company called INSLAW."
>
> — House Judiciary Committee Report, 1992

#### Intelligence Agency Involvement

> "There appears to be strong evidence, as indicated by the findings in two federal court proceedings as well as by the committee's investigation, that the Department of Justice acted willfully and fraudulently, and took, converted and distributed INSLAW's enhanced PROMIS nationwide."
>
> — House Judiciary Committee Report, 1992

#### Committee Findings

> "The full committee could not reach a consensus as to whether or not the PROMIS software had been provided to foreign governments and intelligence agencies."
>
> — House Judiciary Committee Report, 1992

#### Investigation Obstruction

> "The Committee believes that the Justice Department's conduct in INSLAW's civil lawsuit raises serious concerns about whether the Department can investigate itself and about whether the Attorney General can serve effectively as the neutral arbiter of the public interest."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The INSLAW case represents one of the most contentious allegations of government misconduct involving intelligence agencies and proprietary software. The House Judiciary Committee found that the Department of Justice acted "willfully and fraudulently" in taking INSLAW's PROMIS software.

Allegations that the CIA and other intelligence agencies distributed modified versions of PROMIS to foreign governments for surveillance purposes were examined but not definitively resolved by the congressional investigation. The committee explicitly noted it could not reach consensus on whether PROMIS was provided to foreign governments and intelligence agencies.

Two federal courts found in favor of INSLAW before being overturned on jurisdictional rather than substantive grounds. The case illustrates the challenges of investigating allegations involving intelligence agencies, where classified information and national security claims can impede oversight.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Contract dispute:** The matter may have been primarily a commercial contract dispute that was subsequently embellished with conspiracy allegations.

2. **Insufficient evidence:** The appellate court overturn and committee's inability to reach consensus may reflect genuine lack of evidence for broader allegations.

3. **Separate issues:** DOJ contract misconduct (which courts found) may be distinct from alleged intelligence agency distribution (which remained unproven).

4. **Classification barriers:** Inability to confirm allegations may reflect legitimate classification requirements rather than cover-up.
