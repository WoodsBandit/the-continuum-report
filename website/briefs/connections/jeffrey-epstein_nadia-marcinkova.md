### Source: ECF 1331-12 — Sarah Ransome Affidavit

**IMPORTANT:** The following are allegations from a sworn affidavit representing one individual's account.

> "In the summer of 2006, when I was twenty-two years old and living in New York, I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein by a girl I had met named Natalya Malyshov. Shortly after meeting Jeffrey he invited me to fly to his private island in the US Virgin Islands, which I did. After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction... As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, Nadia Macinkova, and various other girls and guests he brought to the island."

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The documentary record establishes that Nadia Marcinkova traveled on Epstein's aircraft and was present at his properties. Flight logs document her travel with Epstein. A sworn affidavit describes her presence during sexual activities at Epstein's locations.

Marcinkova was designated an unindicted co-conspirator in Epstein's 2008 non-prosecution agreement. She invoked Fifth Amendment privileges during civil depositions.

We approach this analysis recognizing significant complexity. The documents do not establish whether Marcinkova herself may have been a victim of trafficking or exploitation. Earlier media reports—not part of the court record we reviewed—have referenced allegations that Epstein brought Marcinkova from Eastern Europe at a young age. If true, this would raise serious questions about her own victimization that would complicate any assessment of her role.

In our assessment, the documentary record presents Marcinkova in circumstances that raise questions we cannot answer from these documents alone. She appears in allegations as a participant, but we cannot determine whether she was an agent, a victim, or occupied a more complex position.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Potential trafficking victim:** If Marcinkova was brought to the United States by Epstein at a young age, her subsequent "participation" may have reflected grooming, coercion, or survival behavior rather than voluntary wrongdoing.

2. **Fifth Amendment protection:** Her invocations reflect constitutionally protected rights exercised on advice of counsel and cannot properly be interpreted as admissions.

3. **Single affiant:** The specific allegations come primarily from Sarah Ransome's affidavit—one person's account that has not been tested through cross-examination.

4. **Absence of charges:** Despite the co-conspirator designation, federal prosecutors have not charged Marcinkova, which may reflect cooperation, evidentiary limitations, or recognition of potential victim status.
