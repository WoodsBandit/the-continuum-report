## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

In our assessment, the Lesley Groff-Sarah Kellen connection represents a relationship defined by shared legal status rather than documented interaction between the two individuals.

**Regarding the shared designation:** Both Groff and Kellen were named as unindicted co-conspirators in the 2008 federal non-prosecution agreement alongside Adriana Ross and Nadia Marcinkova. This shared designation places them in a defined legal category, though it does not establish the nature of their relationship with each other.

**Regarding employment context:** Both individuals are identified in court records as having worked for Jeffrey Epstein in administrative or assistant capacities. The documents do not detail whether they worked together, reported to each other, or had significant professional interaction.

**Regarding the absence of charges:** Neither Groff nor Kellen has been criminally charged despite the co-conspirator designation. The reasons for the designation, and for the decision not to charge, remain outside the public record for both individuals.

**Regarding civil litigation:** Both were named as co-defendants in *Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein et al.*, alongside Maxwell and Natalya Malyshev. Being named together in civil litigation reflects plaintiffs' attorneys' decisions about whom to sue and does not establish facts about their relationship.

**Regarding the thin documentary record:** The connection between Groff and Kellen is primarily one of legal categorization. The documents do not establish personal relationship, coordination of activities, or any facts about how these two individuals interacted, if at all.

## Alternative Interpretations

Reasonable observers might interpret this evidence differently:

1. **Shared legal status does not establish coordination.** Two individuals may be named as co-conspirators without having any relationship with each other, based on their individual relationships to the primary subject.

2. **The co-conspirator designation is not evidence of guilt.** "Unindicted co-conspirator" is a legal term that does not require the same evidentiary showing as criminal charges and does not constitute a finding of wrongdoing.

3. **Administrative employees may have limited knowledge.** Both individuals appear to have worked in assistant roles. Such positions often involve compartmentalized knowledge and may not include awareness of illegal activity.

4. **Either or both may have cooperated.** The non-prosecution agreement may have provided immunity in exchange for cooperation, which would explain both the designation and the absence of charges. This is speculation, but represents a reasonable interpretation.

5. **The nature of any actual relationship is unknown.** The documents establish that both worked for Epstein and share a legal designation, but do not establish whether they interacted, collaborated, or had any meaningful relationship beyond parallel employment.

6. **Either or both may have been victims.** The documents do not address whether Groff or Kellen may have been subject to coercion, manipulation, or exploitation in their employment with Epstein.

## Methodology Note

This connection brief was generated by analyzing court filings from *Giuffre v. Maxwell*, Case No. 15-cv-07433 (S.D.N.Y.). Direct quotes are extracted verbatim from unsealed documents released January 2024. Editorial analysis sections represent protected opinion under First Amendment precedent established in *Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1 (1990).

**Critical Note:** Neither Lesley Groff nor Sarah Kellen has been criminally charged. Neither individual's own account appears in the analyzed documents. The reasons for the "unindicted co-conspirator" designation—and the decisions not to charge either—remain outside the public record. Any characterization of their roles, knowledge, or relationship would be speculative given the available information.
