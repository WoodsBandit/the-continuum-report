From Giuffre's unpublished manuscript included in court exhibits:

> "The next big dinner party on the island had another significant guest appearance being the one and only, Bill Clinton... There was Jeffrey at the head of it all, as always. On the left side was Emmy, Ghislaine and I sitting across the table from us was Bill with two lovely girls who were visiting from New York..."

### Source: ECF 1320-28 — Freeh Report Rebuttal

The Louis Freeh report concluded Clinton was not present on Little St. James Island during the relevant period (2001-2003), contradicting the claims that Maxwell transported Clinton there.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

The Clinton-Maxwell connection in the documentary record centers on Giuffre's claims that Maxwell transported Clinton to Epstein's island:

**Transportation allegation:** Giuffre claimed Maxwell piloted a helicopter to transport Clinton to Epstein's island. This specific allegation was challenged by the Freeh report's conclusion that Clinton was not present on the island during the relevant period.

**Social gathering claims:** Giuffre's manuscript describes a dinner where both Clinton and Maxwell were present. The factual accuracy of this account was disputed in the litigation.

**No misconduct allegations:** As with the Clinton-Epstein connection, Giuffre acknowledged making "no allegations of illegal actions by Bill Clinton." The Maxwell connection appears to be contextual—describing logistics—rather than alleging any wrongdoing by Clinton.

In our assessment, the documentary record presents contested claims about Clinton's presence at events where Maxwell was also present, with significant rebuttal evidence disputing the underlying factual claims.

## Alternative Interpretations

1. **Freeh report contradicts narrative:** The finding that Clinton was not on the island undermines the premise of the Maxwell transportation claim.

2. **Manuscript vs. sworn testimony:** The descriptions come from an unpublished manuscript, not sworn testimony subject to cross-examination.

3. **Social circles overlap:** Both Clinton and Maxwell moved in overlapping philanthropic and social circles, which may account for any legitimate contact.

4. **No allegation of Maxwell-Clinton wrongdoing:** The documents do not allege any improper conduct between Maxwell and Clinton specifically.

5. **Defense characterization:** Maxwell's defense characterized these claims as "conclusively proven false."
