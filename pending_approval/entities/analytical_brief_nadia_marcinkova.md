## Statement of Public Interest

The documents analyzed herein relate to matters of significant public concern. The 2008 non-prosecution agreement involving Jeffrey Epstein and its consequences remain subjects of ongoing public debate and congressional inquiry. These documents were unsealed by federal court order, reflecting judicial determination that public interest outweighs privacy concerns. This analysis is offered in furtherance of informed public discourse.

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Nadia Marcinkova appears in court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil defamation case. Based on our review, she was named as a co-conspirator in the 2008 federal non-prosecution agreement. Flight logs place her on Epstein's aircraft. A sworn affidavit from Sarah Ransome contains allegations regarding Marcinkova's presence during sexual activities. Court filings indicate Marcinkova invoked Fifth Amendment privileges during depositions. Nadia Marcinkova has never been criminally charged with any offense. Her own account does not appear in the analyzed documents, and the documents do not establish whether she herself may have been a victim of exploitation.

## The Public Record

*This section presents direct quotations from court documents without editorial comment.*

### Flight Log Documentation

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24, p. 2:**

> "On December 14, 2006 (Flight #1920), Sarah Ransome flew from TIST (USVI) to EWR (Newark, NJ) with Jeffrey Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova. See Giuffre 07139."

### Sarah Ransome Affidavit

**IMPORTANT:** The following are allegations from a sworn affidavit. They represent one individual's account and have not been tested in court. Nadia Marcinkova has never been charged with any crime and has not had an opportunity to respond to these characterizations in the documents we reviewed.

**[ECF Doc. 1331-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-12.pdf), filed 01/05/24, pp. 8-9** and **[ECF Doc. 1331-32](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-32.pdf), filed 01/05/24, pp. 2-3:**

Sarah Ransome provided a sworn affidavit dated January 5, 2017. Ransome states she was 22 years old in summer 2006—an adult at the time of the events described.

**Paragraph 2:**

> "In the summer of 2006, when I was twenty-two years old and living in New York, I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein by a girl I had met named Natalya. Malyshov. Shortly after meeting Jeffrey he invited me to fly to his private island in the US Virgin Islands, which I did. After that first trip I traveled to the island several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his direction... As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, Nadia Macinkova, and various other girls and guests he brought to the island."

**Paragraph 4:**

> "In addition to spending time with Jeffrey on his island, I spent time with him in New York City. At his town house I was also lent out by him to his friends and associates to have sex. Among the people he lent me to was his friend, Alan Dershowitz. On one occasion I was in a bedroom at Jeffrey's New York townhouse with Jeffrey and Nadia Marcinkova. After a short time, Alan Dershowitz entered the room, after which Jeffrey left the room and Nadia and I had sex with Dershowitz. I recall specific, key details of his person and the sex acts and can describe them in the event it becomes necessary to do so."

**Paragraph 3** (regarding observations of other individuals on the island):

> "During one of my visits to the island I met Ghislaine Maxwell. Watching her interact with the other girls on the island, it became clear to me that she recruited all or many of them to the island. Once they were there, she appeared to be in charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with, and how they were supposed to stay in line. She assumed the same supervisory role with me as soon as I arrived. Some of the girls appeared to be 18 or older, but many appeared to be young teenagers. I recall seeing a particularly young, thin girl who looked well under 18 and recall asking her her age. I later learned was a ballerina. She refused to tell me or let me see her passport."

The affidavit was executed on January 5, 2017, in Barcelona, Spain, before Hsiao-Ching Chang, Vice Consul of the United States of America.

### Fifth Amendment Invocations

**[ECF Doc. 1331-13](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1331-13.pdf), filed 01/05/24, p. 15** (Plaintiff's Opposition to Motion in Limine):

> "Ms. Giuffre took the depositions of Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova. Again, they both took the Fifth on all substantive questions."

### Co-Conspirator Status

Court documents reference Marcinkova as one of four individuals designated as unindicted co-conspirators in the 2008 federal non-prosecution agreement, alongside Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, and Lesley Groff.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

We approach this analysis recognizing that it involves complex questions about victimization, agency, and culpability that the documentary record does not resolve.

**Regarding the allegations:** Sarah Ransome's sworn affidavit describes Marcinkova's presence during sexual activities. We present this as an allegation from one individual's account. Ransome was an adult (22) at the time; her affidavit also describes observing individuals who appeared to be minors on the island, though not specifically in connection with Marcinkova.

**Regarding what the allegations do not establish:** The Ransome affidavit describes Marcinkova's presence and participation in sexual activities, but does not establish Marcinkova's state of mind, whether her participation was voluntary or coerced, her age at relevant times, or the circumstances of her relationship with Epstein.

**Regarding the Fifth Amendment invocations:** Marcinkova invoked Fifth Amendment privileges during depositions. We observe that this is a constitutionally protected right that individuals exercise for many reasons. The invocations do not establish facts about Marcinkova's conduct and cannot properly be interpreted as admissions.

**Regarding the co-conspirator designation:** Marcinkova was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2008 NPA. This designation did not result in criminal charges. The reasons for the designation, and the decision not to charge her, are not explained in the documents we reviewed.

**Regarding the possibility of victimization:** We observe that the documents do not establish whether Marcinkova herself may have been a victim. Earlier media reports—not included in the court documents we reviewed—have referenced allegations that Epstein brought Marcinkova from Eastern Europe at a young age. If true, this would raise significant questions about her own exploitation that would complicate any assessment of her role. We cannot resolve this question based on the documents available to us.

**Our editorial judgment:** The documentary record presents Marcinkova in circumstances that raise questions we cannot answer. She appears in allegations as a participant in activities, but we cannot determine from these documents whether she was an agent, a victim, or occupied some more complex position. Any confident characterization of her role would, in our view, exceed what the evidence supports.

---

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

- **Marcinkova may herself have been a trafficking victim.** If she was brought to the United States by Epstein at a young age, her subsequent "participation" in activities may have reflected grooming, coercion, or survival behavior rather than voluntary wrongdoing. The documents do not resolve this question.

- **The allegations come from a single affiant.** Ransome's affidavit is sworn testimony, but it represents one person's account. The specific allegations regarding Marcinkova have not been tested through cross-examination or adjudicated in any proceeding.

- **Fifth Amendment invocations reflect legal advice, not admissions.** Lawyers routinely advise individuals with potential criminal exposure to invoke Fifth Amendment protections in civil proceedings regardless of actual culpability.

- **The absence of charges is significant.** Despite the co-conspirator designation and the allegations in civil litigation, federal prosecutors have not charged Marcinkova. This may reflect cooperation, evidentiary limitations, recognition of potential victim status, or other factors.

- **Categorizing individuals as "perpetrators" or "victims" may oversimplify reality.** Trafficking and exploitation situations often involve individuals who occupy ambiguous positions—people who may be both victimized and pressured into facilitating harm to others.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.

## Methodology and Limitations

This analysis was generated through AI-assisted review of approximately 14 documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil litigation.

**What we did not review:**
- Nadia Marcinkova's own account or testimony (she invoked Fifth Amendment)
- Documentation of Marcinkova's background, origin, or how she came to be associated with Epstein
- Any statements Marcinkova may have made to law enforcement
- The terms of the 2008 non-prosecution agreement
- Media reporting and investigative journalism about Marcinkova's circumstances

**Critical limitation:** This analysis presents allegations about an individual whose own voice is absent from the record and whose circumstances—including whether she was herself a victim of trafficking or exploitation—are not established in the documents reviewed. Any assessment of her role or culpability is necessarily incomplete and potentially unjust without this context.
