## Statement of Public Interest

Jean-Luc Brunel was a French modeling agent who operated MC2 Model Management, a modeling agency that received startup funding from Jeffrey Epstein. Brunel was arrested in France in December 2020 on charges of rape and sexual assault of minors. He died in his prison cell in February 2022 before trial. Court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case contain extensive references to Brunel, including allegations of trafficking and his appearance on Epstein's flight logs.

---

## Executive Summary

**Editorial Assessment:** Jean-Luc Brunel appears extensively in the documentary record of the Epstein case. Court filings identify him as part of "Epstein's inner circle of friends" and allege that "Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc Brunel many times." Flight logs place him as a frequent passenger on Epstein's aircraft. Depositions from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case include questions about Brunel that were answered with Fifth Amendment invocations. Brunel was arrested in France in December 2020 and was awaiting trial when he was found dead in his cell in February 2022. His death, like Epstein's, occurred before adjudication of the charges against him.

## The Public Record

*This section presents documented facts from court documents without editorial comment.*

### Court Characterization

**[ECF Doc. 1325-3](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1325-3.pdf) (Giuffre v. Maxwell):**

Court filings described Brunel's relationship with Epstein:

> "Another person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc Brunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein's closest friends and a regular traveling companion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. visas for many girls."

### Detailed Trafficking Allegations

**[ECF Doc. 1325-3](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1325-3.pdf) (Joinder Motion, December 30, 2014):**

The motion contains specific allegations about Brunel's activities:

> "Brunel has been a model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. passports for young girls to 'work' as models. He would bring young girls (ranging to ages as young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein."

> "Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to observe him, Brunel and Maxwell engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls. Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with Brunel on numerous occasions, at places including Epstein's mansion in West Palm Beach, Little St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other underage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south of France, and California."

### Subpoena in Giuffre v. Maxwell

**[ECF Doc. 1320-31](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-31.pdf) (Filed 01/03/24):**

Virginia Giuffre served a subpoena on Jean-Luc Brunel to produce documents:

> "Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, hereby provides Notice of Service of Subpoena to Produce Documents, Information, or Objects or to Permit Inspection of Premises upon Jean Luc Brunel."

### Deposition Testimony — Fifth Amendment Invocations

**[ECF Doc. 1328-44](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1328-44.pdf) (Filed 01/05/24):**

Deposition questions regarding Brunel were met with Fifth Amendment invocations:

> Q: How many times have you ridden on the airplane with Jean Luc Brunel?
> A: Fifth.

> Q: Each time that Jean Luc Brunel visits Jeffrey Epstein's house, does he bring underage minors to Jeffrey Epstein's house to engage in [sexual activity]?
> A: Fifth.

> Q: Is that somebody that was a sexual abuse victim at one point in time of Jeffrey Epstein and Jean Luc Brunel?
> A: Fifth.

### Litigation Motion Practice

**[ECF Doc. 1320-28](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-28.pdf) (Filed 01/03/24):**

Court documents indicate disputes over Brunel's deposition:

> "Plaintiff also seeks to untimely depose (3) Jean Luc Brunel, a witness she had noticed for a mid-June deposition, who apparently did not appear on that date with agreement and consent of Plaintiff's counsel."

### Co-Occurrence in Deposition Records

**[ECF Doc. 1320-12](https://thecontinuumreport.com/sources/giuffre-v-maxwell/ecf-1320-12.pdf) (Johanna Sjoberg Deposition, 179 pages):**

Brunel's name appears in the deposition of Johanna Sjoberg alongside other individuals in Epstein's network, including Ghislaine Maxwell, Prince Andrew, Bill Richardson, and Les Wexner.

### Flight Logs

According to Epstein flight logs (Document IDs 204, 205 in Paperless), Jean-Luc Brunel appears as a passenger on multiple flights on Epstein's aircraft between the 1990s and 2000s.

### MC2 Model Management

Brunel operated MC2 Model Management, a modeling agency. Published accounts indicate Jeffrey Epstein provided startup funding for this agency. The agency operated in Miami and New York.

### French Arrest and Death

Jean-Luc Brunel was arrested at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on December 16, 2020. He was charged with:
- Rape of minors
- Sexual assault
- Sexual harassment
- Human trafficking for sexual exploitation

On February 19, 2022, Brunel was found dead in his prison cell at La Santé Prison in Paris. French authorities ruled his death a suicide by hanging.

## Editorial Analysis

**The following represents the opinions and interpretations of The Continuum Report.**

**Regarding the court characterizations:** The court filing describing Brunel as part of Epstein's "inner circle" and alleging he received trafficking victims from Epstein is significant. These characterizations appear in plaintiff's court filings and represent allegations, not adjudicated facts. However, the specificity of the allegations and their inclusion in federal court proceedings establishes their seriousness.

**Regarding the Fifth Amendment invocations:** The multiple Fifth Amendment invocations in response to questions about Brunel are documented fact. Fifth Amendment invocations reflect constitutionally protected rights and should not be interpreted as evidence of guilt. However, the nature of the questions—asking about whether Brunel brought underage minors to Epstein's home—establishes what investigators believed warranted inquiry.

**Regarding the modeling industry connection:** Brunel's role as a modeling agent who received Epstein funding raises questions about recruitment methods. The modeling industry provides access to young women seeking employment. We observe this structural opportunity without asserting it was used criminally in any specific instance beyond the allegations in court filings.

**Regarding the allegations of visa procurement:** The court filing's allegation that Brunel "was able to get U.S. passports for young girls" to bring them to the United States suggests potential immigration-related concerns. This specific allegation, if true, would implicate systematic abuse of immigration processes.

**Regarding his death:** Like Epstein, Brunel died before his criminal case was adjudicated. The circumstances—both men dying in custody before trial—have generated public speculation. French authorities ruled Brunel's death a suicide. We note this official finding while acknowledging the death prevented any trial verdict.

**Our editorial judgment:** Jean-Luc Brunel represents a significant figure in the Epstein network based on documentary evidence. Court filings, flight logs, and his eventual French arrest establish documented connections to Epstein and serious allegations. His death before trial means these allegations were never tested in court.

## Alternative Interpretations

A reader reviewing these same documents might reasonably conclude:

1. **Allegations not adjudicated:** Brunel died before trial and was never convicted. The presumption of innocence applies, and the allegations remain unproven in court.

2. **Plaintiff characterizations:** The "inner circle" language comes from plaintiff's filings, which present one side's characterization of evidence.

3. **Fifth Amendment protection:** Witnesses invoke the Fifth Amendment for many reasons, including on advice of counsel in civil litigation with potential criminal implications.

4. **Business relationship:** Brunel may have had a legitimate modeling business relationship with Epstein separate from any criminal activity.

5. **Timing questions:** Brunel's arrest came only after Epstein's death and Maxwell's arrest, raising questions about why earlier law enforcement action was not taken if the allegations were known.

6. **Geographic scope:** The allegations span multiple countries (US, France, Virgin Islands), which may have complicated law enforcement jurisdiction and coordination.

7. **Death circumstances:** While French authorities ruled Brunel's death a suicide, some observers question the circumstances given the similarity to Epstein's death.

The Continuum Report presents one analytical framework. Readers are encouraged to review the source documents and form their own conclusions.
