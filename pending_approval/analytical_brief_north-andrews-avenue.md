This location serves as the professional office of the law firm FARMER, JAFFE, WEISSING, EDWARDS, FISTOS & LEHRMAN, P.L. Within the source documents reviewed, this address appears exclusively as contact information for Attorney Bradley J. Edwards, who serves as counsel for the plaintiff in the Giuffre v.

## ASSESSMENT

### Intelligence Value: LOW

This entity represents a standard professional address with no independent investigative significance. Its presence in the document corpus is incidental to the administrative requirements of legal filings.

### Entity Classification Recommendation

The entity type should be updated from "unknown" to "location" in the entity registry. Subcategory: "professional-address" or "law-office."

### Analytical Conclusions

1. **No substantive relevance:** The address does not appear in connection with any factual allegations, witness accounts, or evidentiary matters in the litigation.

2. **Administrative function only:** All mentions serve the procedural purpose of identifying counsel contact information.

3. **Network utility limited:** While the address connects to relevant legal professionals, these relationships are better captured through direct attorney and law firm entity entries.

4. **Low priority for further analysis:** No additional research or context gathering is warranted for this entity.

### Recommendations

- Update entity type from "unknown" to "location" in entity registry
- Consider flagging as "administrative entity" to deprioritize in future analysis queues
- Cross-reference complete for related attorney entities (Bradley J. Edwards, Farmer Jaffe firm)
- No standalone publication recommended; information may be incorporated into attorney/firm profiles if relevant
