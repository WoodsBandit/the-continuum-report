**Source:** The Daily Beast, June 2025
**Entities:** Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein

### Summary

According to The Daily Beast, a bank has been cited for processing financial transactions on behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein's July 2019 arrest. The specific institution, transaction amounts, and regulatory action involved are not detailed in the available excerpt.

### Key Details

- A financial institution allegedly facilitated money movement for Ghislaine Maxwell following Epstein's arrest (The Daily Beast, June 2025)
- The timing suggests transactions occurred during the period when Maxwell was evading law enforcement (July 2019 – July 2020)
- The nature of the regulatory or legal action against the bank ("busted") requires verification against the full source document

### Connection to Existing Research

This report relates directly to two key figures in the Continuum manifest: Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. Financial facilitation after Epstein's arrest would intersect with the documented timeline of Maxwell's flight from authorities before her July 2020 arrest in Bradford, New Hampshire. Previous briefs have examined Maxwell's financial arrangements during this period.

### Alternative Interpretations

- The bank may have processed routine transactions without knowledge of Maxwell's legal status, which would indicate compliance failures rather than intentional concealment
- The term "busted" may refer to civil regulatory penalties rather than criminal charges, suggesting a lower threshold of culpability for the institution

### Status

- [x] Pending human review
- [ ] Verified against source
- [ ] Approved for publication
