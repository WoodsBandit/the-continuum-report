**Source:** Law & Crime, October 2025
**Entities:** Donald Trump

### Summary

Christopher Moynihan, 35, of New York, pleaded guilty to second-degree aggravated harassment after threatening to assassinate House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Moynihan had previously received a pardon from President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, for his participation in the January 6 Capitol riot. According to court documents, Moynihan stated in text messages: "I will kill him for the future."

### Key Details

- Moynihan pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge; prosecutors dropped the felony "making a terrorist threat" charge as part of the plea agreement (Dutchess County District Attorney press release)
- Text messages obtained in the criminal complaint stated: "Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live" and "Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated" (CBS News, criminal complaint)
- The threat referenced Jeffries' scheduled speech at the Economic Club of New York
- Rep. Jeffries characterized the threat as "credible" and stated the suspect "had every intention to carry it out" (Jeffries statement)
- Moynihan was among those pardoned by Trump on his first day in office for actions during the January 6 Capitol riot, where he ransacked a desk in Congress (FBI court filings)

### Connection to Existing Research

This case intersects with documentation of President Trump's January 6 pardons. The incident raises questions about post-pardon conduct among those granted clemency for January 6-related offenses.

### Alternative Interpretations

- The plea to a misdemeanor rather than a felony terrorism charge could indicate prosecutorial assessment that the threat, while criminal, did not meet the higher evidentiary threshold
- The case may represent an isolated incident rather than a pattern among pardoned individuals
