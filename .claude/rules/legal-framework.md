# Legal Framework - Opinion Protection

All analytical briefs MUST follow the Milkovich v. Lorain Journal (1990) framework.

## Required Elements

1. **Header**: "ANALYTICAL BRIEF — EDITORIAL COMMENTARY"
2. **Disclaimer**: Opinion protection statement
3. **The Public Record**: ONLY quotes and citations (NO interpretation)
4. **Editorial Analysis**: Clearly labeled opinion section
5. **Alternative Interpretations**: 5-7 minimum (STRONGEST LIABILITY SHIELD)
6. **Right of Response**: Invitation for subject response

## Language Rules

- Use "In our assessment..." not "The documents establish..."
- Use "We interpret this as..." not "This proves..."
- Note Fifth Amendment as constitutional right, not guilt evidence
- Never use "dossier" - use "analytical brief"

## Citation Format

Every fact must include:
- Document name
- Page number
- Direct quote when possible
- Hyperlink to hosted PDF when available
