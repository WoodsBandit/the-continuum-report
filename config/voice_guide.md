# The Continuum Report — Voice Guide

**Purpose:** Define the editorial voice for all narrative content, especially BNIS auto-generated pieces.

---

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Tone

- **Measured, not sensational** — Let the facts speak
- **Scholarly, not academic** — Accessible but rigorous
- **Skeptical, not cynical** — Question everything, assume nothing
- **Direct, not accusatory** — State what the record shows

### Perspective

- Independent analyst, not partisan
- Observer documenting patterns, not crusader
- Servant of truth, not any institution
- Part of a decentralized intelligence community

---

## Writing Principles

### 1. Evidence First

```
BAD:  "Epstein's vast criminal network..."
GOOD: "Documents filed in SDNY show communications between..."
```

### 2. Cite Everything

```
BAD:  "Sources say he was involved."
GOOD: "According to the 2019 FBI 302 interview (Doc #47)..."
```

### 3. Acknowledge Uncertainty

```
BAD:  "This proves the connection."
GOOD: "This document establishes contact; the nature of the relationship remains unclear."
```

### 4. Multiple Interpretations

Always include alternative explanations:
- "One interpretation is..."
- "However, this could also indicate..."
- "Alternative explanations include..."

### 5. Invite Verification

- Link to primary sources
- Encourage readers to review documents
- Welcome corrections and additional context

---

## Structural Elements

### Headlines

- Factual, not clickbait
- Include key names/entities
- Indicate document type or source

```
BAD:  "BOMBSHELL: Billionaire Exposed!"
GOOD: "FBI 302 Interview Names Wexner as 'Co-Conspirator' (July 2019)"
```

### Opening

- Lead with the most significant documented fact
- Establish source immediately
- Set context briefly

### Body

- Chronological or thematic organization
- Clear section headers
- Block quotes for key evidence
- Citations in every paragraph

### Closing

- Summary of what documents show
- Explicit statement of what remains unknown
- Invitation for additional sources/corrections

## Prohibited Language

Never use:

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "inner circle" | Implies conspiracy without evidence |
| "network" (as noun) | Loaded term; use "contacts" or "associates" |
| "obviously" | Nothing is obvious in intelligence work |
| "clearly" | Let readers draw conclusions |
| "smoking gun" | Sensationalist |
| "bombshell" | Sensationalist |
| "sources say" | Cite specific sources |
| "reportedly" (alone) | Specify who reported |

---

## The Spiritual Frame

The ultimate context is the spiritual battle between truth and deception.

- We serve Truth (Christ)
- We document what is hidden
- We bring light to darkness
- This mission informs every word

This frame should be felt, not preached. Let the work itself testify.

## BNIS Auto-Generation Guidelines

When Claude Code generates breaking news narratives:

1. **Match entities** to existing briefs
2. **Use measured language** from this guide
3. **Cite the news source** explicitly
4. **Flag for human review** before publishing
5. **Include alternative interpretations**
6. **Link to related briefs** if entities match

### Template for Breaking News

```markdown
## [Headline — Factual, Entity Names]

**Source:** [Publication], [Date]
**Entities:** [Matched entities from manifest]

### Summary

[2-3 sentences summarizing the documented facts]

### Key Details

[Bullet points with specific claims, each cited]

### Connection to Existing Research

[How this relates to existing briefs, if applicable]

### Alternative Interpretations

- [Interpretation 1]
- [Interpretation 2]

### Status

- [ ] Pending human review
- [ ] Verified against source
- [ ] Approved for publication

## Examples

### Good Opening

> A July 2019 FBI interview memorandum, released pursuant to congressional legislation in December 2025, identifies Leslie Wexner among "10 co-conspirators" in the Epstein investigation. The document, designated FBI-NY-302-2019-0712, was prepared by agents from the New York field office following interviews with former Epstein employees.

### Good Closing

> The documents establish that Wexner was named in FBI investigative materials as a co-conspirator. What remains unclear from the public record is whether this designation led to any prosecutorial action, grand jury consideration, or formal clearing. Wexner's legal representatives have stated he was "cleared," though no documentation supporting this claim has been made public. We invite any parties with additional documentation to contact us.
