# Legal Framework — Complete Reference

**The Continuum Report**
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-25

---

## Overview

All content restructured from "DOSSIERS" to "ANALYTICAL BRIEFS" to invoke First Amendment opinion protections under *Milkovich v. Lorain Journal* (1990).

---

## The New Framework

We operate under *Milkovich v. Lorain Journal* (1990) opinion protection by:

1. Clearly labeling content as editorial commentary
2. Separating documented facts from interpretation
3. Using opinion-signaling language
4. Acknowledging alternative interpretations
5. Inviting subject responses

---

## Required Document Header

```markdown
> **ANALYTICAL BRIEF — EDITORIAL COMMENTARY**
>
> *The Continuum Report — Another Node in the Decentralized Intelligence Agency*
>
> This document constitutes opinion and analysis based on public court records.
> Interpretive conclusions represent editorial judgment, not assertions of fact.
> Readers are encouraged to review cited sources and form independent conclusions.
```

## The Three Categories of Statements

| Category | Location | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **DOCUMENTED FACT** | "The Public Record" section ONLY | "According to ECF Doc. 1328-44, filed 01/05/24..." |
| **ALLEGATION** | Clearly attributed | "The plaintiff alleged in court filings that..." |
| **EDITORIAL ANALYSIS** | "Editorial Analysis" section | "In our assessment, the documentary record suggests..." |

---

## Required Brief Structure

Every analytical brief MUST include:

1. Opinion-protection header and disclaimer
2. Document Classification table (Subject, Status, Sources)
3. Statement of Public Interest
4. Executive Summary (with opinion-signaling language)
5. **The Public Record** (ONLY quotes and citations — NO interpretation)
6. **Editorial Analysis** (clearly labeled opinion section)
7. **Alternative Interpretations** (5-7 minimum — STRONGEST LIABILITY SHIELD)
8. Source Documents table
9. Methodology and Limitations
10. Right of Response invitation

## Language Guidelines

| DON'T Write | DO Write |
|----------------|-------------|
| "was part of the inner circle" | "In our assessment, the documentary record suggests operated in close proximity to..." |
| "The documents establish..." | "Based on our review..." |
| "This proves..." | "We interpret this as..." |
| "[Subject] had substantial involvement" | "Court filings reference [Subject] in connection with..." |
| [Fifth Amendment with no context] | "Fifth Amendment invocations reflect constitutionally protected rights and should not be interpreted as evidence of wrongdoing" |

---

## Legal Protections Applied

| Protection | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| **Fair Report Privilege** | "The Public Record" section — accurate reporting of official proceedings |
| **Opinion Protection** | "Editorial Analysis" section — statements that cannot be proven true/false |
| **Actual Malice Defense** | Alternative Interpretations section defeats malice claims |
| **Florida Anti-SLAPP** | Fla. Stat. § 768.295 — our jurisdiction |

## Editorial Standards — What We DO

- ✅ Acknowledge alternative interpretations in every brief
- ✅ Invite responses from subjects
- ✅ Provide verifiable sources with direct links
- ✅ Cite primary sources over secondary

## Editorial Standards — What We DON'T Do

- ❌ Assert as fact anything not directly quoted from sources
- ❌ Use loaded characterizations ("inner circle," "network")
- ❌ Imply guilt through rhetorical questions
- ❌ Present attorney questions as allegations
- ❌ Treat Fifth Amendment as evidence of guilt
- ❌ Publish without Alternative Interpretations section
- ❌ Speculate beyond what documents show
- ❌ Include private individuals not in public records
- ❌ Use "dossier" terminology (use "analytical brief")
