## Notes on Entity Extraction

### Limitations & Considerations
1. Many entries in ecf-1320-13.md appear to be vehicle descriptions, organization names, and location descriptors rather than individual people (e.g., "Black Cadillac Escalade", "Palm Beach County", "Grand Jury")

2. Some names may be duplicates with slight spelling variations (e.g., "Nadia Marcinkova" vs "Nadia Marcinko")

3. The extraction process captured organizational roles and titles as separate entities (e.g., "Defense Attorney Alan", "Professor Paul Cassell")

4. Document filing dates are largely from 2024 unsealing, but reference events from 2000s-2010s

5. Many individuals listed have "Address Unknown" notations in witness lists, indicating difficulty in locating witnesses
