## Summary

This is a brief declaration filed by attorney Sigrid S. McCawley in support of Virginia Giuffre's reply motion to exceed the presumptive ten-deposition limit. The document serves as a cover sheet authenticating three deposition transcript excerpts that were attached as exhibits to support the legal arguments made in the accompanying reply brief (ecf-1320-21).

**Purpose:**
The declaration formally authenticates and introduces into evidence excerpts from three key witness depositions taken in May-June 2016.

**Exhibits Authenticated:**
1. **Exhibit 1**: Johanna Sjoberg's deposition transcript excerpts (May 18, 2016)
2. **Exhibit 2**: Rinaldo Rizzo's rough deposition transcript excerpts (June 10, 2016)
3. **Exhibit 3**: Juan Alessi's deposition transcript excerpts (June 1, 2016)

**Legal Team for Giuffre:**
- Sigrid McCawley (Pro Hac Vice) - Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, Fort Lauderdale
- Meredith Schultz (Pro Hac Vice) - Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, Fort Lauderdale
- David Boies - Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, Armonk, NY
- Bradley J. Edwards (Pro Hac Vice) - Farmer, Jaffe, Weissing, Edwards, Fistos & Lehrman, P.L.
- Paul G. Cassell (Pro Hac Vice) - S.J. Quinney College of Law, University of Utah

**Opposing Counsel for Maxwell:**
- Laura A. Menninger - Haddon, Morgan & Foreman, P.C., Denver, Colorado
- Jeffrey Pagliuca - Haddon, Morgan & Foreman, P.C., Denver, Colorado

**Significance:**
This declaration is procedurally necessary to introduce the deposition testimony referenced in the main reply brief. The three witnesses whose testimony is authenticated here provided critical evidence about:
- Sjoberg: Maxwell's recruitment of young women for sexual purposes
- Rizzo: Maxwell threatening a 15-year-old and organizing sexual activities with minors
- Alessi: Maxwell's possession of photographs that were never produced in discovery

The document was originally filed under seal on June 13, 2016, and publicly released on January 3, 2024.
