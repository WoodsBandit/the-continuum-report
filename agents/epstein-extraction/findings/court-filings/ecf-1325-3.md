## Key Quotes

### On Ghislaine Maxwell's Role

>"In 1999, Jane Doe #3 was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main women whom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme." (p. 3)

>"In fact, it became known to the government that Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane Doe #3." (p. 3)

>"Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein's mansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2)." (p. 3)

>"When Jane Doe #3 began giving Epstein a 'massage,' Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as they had done with many other victims." (p. 3)

>"Maxwell facilitated Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a 'madame' for Epstein, thereby assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual purposes." (p. 6)

>"In addition to participating in the sexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3. She shared these photographs (which constituted child pornography under applicable federal laws) with Epstein. The Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these photographs." (p. 5-6)

### On "Sex Slave" Status

>"Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and with the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a 'sex slave.' Epstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about 1999 through 2002, when she managed to escape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years." (p. 3)

### On Sexual Trafficking

>"Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to politically-connected and financially-powerful people. Epstein's purposes in 'lending' Jane Doe (along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail information." (p. 3-4)

>"Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them." (p. 6-7)

### On Alan Dershowitz

>"One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's and well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands." (p. 4)

>"In addition to being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshowitz was an eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's co-conspirators." (p. 4)

>"Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein's behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to 'any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.' Thus, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for sexually abusing Jane Doe #3." (p. 4-5)

>"Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's defense team) and the Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein's victims and the general public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act." (p. 5)

### On Prince Andrew

>"For instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3 was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New York, and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls)." (p. 6)

>"Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse." (p. 6)

### On Jean Luc Brunel

>"Another person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc Brunel many times." (p. 6)

>"Brunel has been a model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. passports for young girls to 'work' as models. He would bring young girls (ranging to ages as young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein." (p. 6-7)

>"Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to observe him, Brunel and Maxwell engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls. Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with Brunel on numerous occasions, at places including Epstein's mansion in West Palm Beach, Little St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other underage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south of France, and California." (p. 7)

### On Government Concealment

>"The Government was well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the attachment to the NPA." (p. 6)

>"Nonetheless, the Government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any Federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As with Jane Doe #1, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement from Jane Doe #3 – all in violation of her rights under the CVRA – to avoid Jane Doe #3 from raising powerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other powerful individuals and that would likely have been prevented it from being concluded in the secretive manner in which it was." (p. 6-7)

## Summary

This is the controversial December 2014 "Joinder Motion" filed in the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) case in Florida, where Virginia Giuffre (Jane Doe #3) and another victim (Jane Doe #4) sought to join the existing lawsuit against the U.S. Government. This document later became Exhibit C in Ghislaine Maxwell's response to Sharon Churcher's motion to quash.

**Jane Doe #3's Allegations (Virginia Giuffre):**

The motion alleges that in 1999, when Jane Doe #3 was 15 years old, she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell. According to the filing:

1. **Recruitment and "Sex Slave" Status:** Maxwell allegedly persuaded the 15-year-old to come to Epstein's mansion. When she began giving Epstein a massage, "Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter." The filing states Epstein "became enamored" with Jane Doe #3 and "with the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a 'sex slave'" from 1999-2002.

2. **Sexual Trafficking:** The motion alleges Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to:
   - **Alan Dershowitz**: "On numerous occasions" in Florida, on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and U.S. Virgin Islands
   - **Prince Andrew**: Three times (London at Maxwell's apartment, New York, and Epstein's private island "in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls")
   - **Jean Luc Brunel**: Multiple times in various locations
   - Unnamed "numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders"

3. **Dershowitz's Dual Role:** The motion alleges Dershowitz both sexually abused Jane Doe #3 AND helped negotiate the NPA that provided immunity for "any potential co-conspirators of Epstein" - effectively negotiating protection for himself.

4. **Maxwell's Activities:** The filing alleges Maxwell:
   - Regularly participated in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors
   - Took sexually explicit photographs of underage girls (child pornography)
   - Acted as a "madame" for Epstein
   - Facilitated international trafficking

5. **Government Knowledge:** The motion states the government was "well aware" of Jane Doe #3 when negotiating the NPA and listed her as a victim in the attachment, but concealed the agreement from her in violation of CVRA.

**Jane Doe #4's Allegations:**

A separate victim who alleges she was recruited in summer 2002 at age 16 through another Epstein victim, promised $300 for a massage, and subsequently sexually abused by Epstein on many occasions.

**Legal Significance:**

This motion is significant because it's the first public filing of these specific allegations against Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz. The allegations in this document became the basis for the defamation lawsuit Giuffre later filed against Maxwell, after Maxwell publicly denied them and called Giuffre a liar.

The motion was filed by Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell as part of their representation of victims in the CVRA case challenging the secret non-prosecution agreement.
