## Key Quotes

### On Churcher's Role in Fabricating Stories

>"Churcher is the sole source of information regarding the original story told by Plaintiff, and was the author of the first articles publishing Plaintiff's claims. She was actively and personally involved in changing those stories over time and in the creation and addition of new salacious details about public figures, including the fabrication of Alan Dershowitz's alleged sexual relations with Plaintiff." (p. 1)

>"In that role, she helped manufacture some of the stories that have been denied and that are the central issues in this case." (p. 1)

### On Prince Andrew Allegations

>"[t]here is no suggestion that there was any sexual contact between Virginia and Andrew, or that Andrew knew that Epstein paid her to have sex with his friends." - Churcher's March 2011 article (p. 4)

>"Shortly thereafter, on March 20, 2011, Churcher emailed Plaintiff explaining to her how she can corroborate a story to tell the FBI – that she was 'given to' Prince Andrew. Churcher provided an explanation for how Plaintiff can substantiate the claim – a claim not previously made by Plaintiff." (p. 4-5)

### On Dershowitz Allegations

Email from Giuffre to Churcher, May 10, 2011:
>"Just wondering if you have any information on you from when you and I were doing interviews about the J.E. story. I wanted to put the names of these assholes, oops I meant to say, pedo's, that J.E. sent me to. With everything going on my brain feels like mush and it would be a great deal of help!..." (p. 6)

Churcher's reply, May 11, 2011:
>"Don't forget Alan Dershowitz... JE's buddy and lawyer -good name for your pitch as he repped Claus von Bulow and a movie was made about that case ... title was Reversal of Fortune. We all suspect Alan is a pedo and tho no proof of that, you probably met him when he was hanging put w JE" (p. 6)

### On the Fabricated Diary

>"This alleged 24 page 'diary' or 'journal' was a completely fabricated document handwritten by Plaintiff at the request and direction of Churcher." (p. 5)

>"In actuality, the only journal Plaintiff ever maintained that might contain relevant information was purposefully destroyed by Plaintiff in a bonfire in 2013, at a time when she was represented by counsel and actively trying to insert herself as a Plaintiff in the CVRA case." (p. 5, footnote 2)

### On Maxwell's Alleged Defamatory Statement

>"Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms. Roberts that Alan Dershowitz is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies. Ms. Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicized as news, as they are defamatory." (p. 1, 15)

### On Churcher's Non-Journalistic Activities

>"Churcher is not a journalist; she is a co-conspirator in Plaintiff's publication of false statements regarding numerous people including Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz and Ms. Maxwell." (p. 7)

>"As Churcher puts it, the only incentives are 'deadlines and/or cash'." (p. 7)

### On Bill Clinton Story

>"Bill Clinton is referenced in the flight logs. Before 2011, Plaintiff never mentioned or references President Clinton. Yet, suddenly and out of thin air, Plaintiff allegedly reports to Churcher in 2011 that she met Bill Clinton twice, and that Ms. Maxwell flew President Clinton on a helicopter to Mr. Epstein's Island – a story which has since been fully discredited as a lie." (p. 13)

### On Giuffre's Changing Age Claims

>"Plaintiff now admits that she did not meet Epstein in 1999, but rather met him in 2000 which was the year she worked at the Mar-A-Lago. Plaintiff's claims about meeting Epstein in 1998 or 1999, and her claim of being 15, are lies." (p. 12-13)

### On Payment to Giuffre

>"Plaintiff was paid over $140,000 to go 'on record.'" (p. 9)

## Summary

This is Ghislaine Maxwell's response to journalist Sharon Churcher's motion to quash a subpoena for documents and testimony in the defamation case brought by Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The document argues that Churcher was not acting as a journalist but as a friend and advisor who actively helped Giuffre fabricate and embellish allegations against public figures.

**Key Arguments:**

1. **Churcher Was Not Acting as a Journalist:** Maxwell's attorneys argue that Churcher acted as Giuffre's friend, book advisor, and publicist rather than as an objective journalist gathering news. They cite extensive email correspondence showing Churcher:
   - Recommending ghostwriters and agents for Giuffre's book
   - Strategizing with Giuffre on how to maximize book publicity
   - Requesting Giuffre create a handwritten "diary" of alleged encounters with Prince Andrew
   - Suggesting names to add to Giuffre's story, including Alan Dershowitz

2. **Evidence of Story Fabrication:** The document presents what it characterizes as proof that Giuffre's story changed over time with Churcher's involvement:
   - **Prince Andrew:** Churcher's March 2011 articles stated no sexual contact occurred, but by December 2014, Giuffre alleged sexual encounters
   - **Alan Dershowitz:** Giuffre asked Churcher for names of people Epstein allegedly sent her to; Churcher suggested Dershowitz, stating "We all suspect Alan is a pedo"
   - **Age and Timeline:** Giuffre's claims about when she met Epstein changed from 1998 (age 15) to 1999 (age 15) to 2000 (age 16-17)

3. **No Confidentiality/Shield Law Protection:** Maxwell argues Churcher cannot claim journalist privilege because:
   - Communications with Giuffre were not confidential
   - Churcher shared information with FBI and law enforcement (not in journalistic capacity)
   - Churcher communicated with Giuffre's attorneys
   - Much activity related to book writing, not news gathering

4. **Critical Evidence:** The document argues Churcher's testimony and documents are essential to Maxwell's truth defense because:
   - Churcher is the only source for interview notes, recordings, and the fabricated diary
   - She can testify about how Giuffre's story changed over time
   - She has the original Prince Andrew photograph or chain of custody information
   - Giuffre herself claims not to remember what she told Churcher

This filing provides significant insight into Maxwell's defense strategy: attempting to prove Giuffre fabricated or embellished her allegations with Churcher's assistance, thereby establishing the "truth" of Maxwell's allegedly defamatory statement that Giuffre's claims were "obvious lies."
