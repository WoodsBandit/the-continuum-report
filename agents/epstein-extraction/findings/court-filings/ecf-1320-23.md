## Summary

This document contains selected excerpts from Johanna Sjoberg's confidential deposition taken on May 18, 2016, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The excerpts were filed as Exhibit 1 to Sigrid McCawley's declaration supporting Giuffre's motion to exceed the deposition limit. The deposition was originally filed under seal and later unsealed on January 3, 2024.

**Key Testimony Areas:**

**1. Prince Andrew Photo Incident (Pages 3-4):**
Sjoberg testified that when she arrived at Epstein's New York home, she found Virginia Giuffre, Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew, and Ghislaine Maxwell present. Maxwell retrieved a puppet caricature of Prince Andrew from a closet. They staged a photo where:
- Virginia and Andrew sat on a couch
- The puppet was placed on Virginia's lap
- Sjoberg sat on Andrew's lap
- The puppet's hand was placed on Virginia's breast
- Andrew placed his hand on Sjoberg's breast
- A photo was taken with Maxwell present

Sjoberg testified she never saw the photo afterward and could not recall who took it.

**2. Maxwell's Recruitment of Girls (Page 5):**
Sjoberg confirmed that Maxwell asked her to bring other girls to Epstein. She testified that:
- She brought a girl (name redacted as Jane Doe 2) from a restaurant where she worked
- Maxwell gave her money to bring this girl over
- The girl was never actually called to come
- She also brought a physical fitness instructor

**3. Sexual Expectations and "Finishing the Job" (Pages 6-7):**
Sjoberg testified about Maxwell's expectations regarding sexual acts during massages. The "camera incident" involved Maxwell telling Sjoberg she "hadn't finished the job," which Sjoberg understood to mean bringing Epstein to orgasm. She confirmed that she understood Maxwell expected her to perform sexual acts when massaging Epstein.

**4. Maxwell's Statement About Sexual Pressure (Pages 6, 8-9):**
Critically, Sjoberg testified that Maxwell told her that having other girls around would "take pressure off" Maxwell sexually. Maxwell specifically stated "she doesn't have the time or desire to please him as much as he needs, and that's why there were other girls around."

**5. Requests for Photographs (Page 8):**
Maxwell asked Sjoberg to take photographs of herself for Jeffrey in connection with a camera Maxwell had bought for her. Sjoberg testified she never followed through with this request.

**6. Other Incidents:**
- Emmy on the plane incident (page 7): Epstein told Sjoberg a story about Emmy assuming he wanted oral sex when he woke her for landing
- Fitness instructor incident (page 6): Epstein lifted the instructor's shirt, exposed her bra; told the instructor he had taken "this girl's virginity"

**Significance:**
This testimony corroborates Virginia Giuffre's claims that:
1. Maxwell recruited and managed young women for Epstein's sexual gratification
2. Maxwell was present during inappropriate sexual conduct involving Prince Andrew
3. Maxwell explicitly stated her role was to provide girls to satisfy Epstein sexually
4. There was an expectation that young women would perform sexual acts on Epstein
5. Maxwell was directly involved in procuring girls and managing sexual expectations

The deposition was taken by plaintiff's counsel at Boies Schiller & Flexner's Fort Lauderdale office and certified by Notary Public Kelli Ann Willis.
