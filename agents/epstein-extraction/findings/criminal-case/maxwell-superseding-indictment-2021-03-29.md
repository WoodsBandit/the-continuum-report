## Key Quotes

### Challenge to Authentication
"There are two fundamental flaws with the government's evidentiary proffer regarding proposed Exhibit 52. First, as a matter of fact, Government Exhibit 52 was not something that the cooperating government witness reviewed, used, or saw during her brief employment with Jeffrey Epstein." (page 1)

"Records produced in discovery reflect that witness began working for Epstein in [redacted]. At that point, the suspect source of Government Exhibit 52, Alfredo Rodriguez, was not employed by Epstein because he had been fired in 2004." (page 1)

### Alteration of Evidence
"According to Mr. Rodriguez, when he left the Epstein home he took an address book, which he claimed was Epstein's book, and had it in his possession until 2009 when he tried to sell it to Brad Edwards for $50,000." (page 1)

"The book was clearly altered by Mr. Rodriguez. The single page that the government intends to offer has various handwritten notations on the copy. The book, as an entire document, contains numerous handwritten notations, added tabs, and additional handwritten pages." (pages 1-2)

### Suspicious Circumstances
"Mr. Rodriguez knew the target of his intended sale which makes the likelihood of alteration all the more probable. Mr. Edwards was a lawyer with of the Fort Lauderdale law firm of Rothstein Rosenfelt Adler. The firm was under investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida for a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme, involving falsifying documents, including police reports and court pleadings, specifically against Epstein; blackmailing targeted defendants to settle false allegations of sexual harassment and abuse; and devising an investment scheme involving pre-trial funding in the guise of structured settlements." (pages 1-2, footnote)

### Legal Standards
"The party offering an exhibit must demonstrate 'evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.' Fed. R. Evid. 901(a)." (page 2)

"'The requirement under Rule 901 is satisfied "if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification."'" (page 2, quoting United States v. Dhinsa)

"The government cannot meet this minimal threshold here." (page 2)

### Defense Requests
"Ms. Maxwell respectfully suggests that this issue cannot be resolved by the Court without consideration of the evidence and the witness through whom the government will attempt authentication. Ms. Maxwell requests that the government be precluded from discussing the book at trial prior to a proper evidentiary foundation being established." (pages 2-3)

"In addition, the government should be required to produce the entire book for inspection at trial and counsel for Ms. Maxwell should be afforded an opportunity to conduct voir dire of the exhibit with the proffering witness." (page 3)

### Discovery Extension Dispute
"In particular, on November 4, 2020, the Government asked defense counsel whether they would consent to a two-week extension to allow adequate time for an outside vendor to finish bates stamping and downloading the Production." (certification, page 1)

"On the morning of November 6, 2020, defense counsel indicated that they would consent to the requested extension on four conditions." (certification, page 2)

## Summary

This document is a defense pretrial motion challenging the admissibility of "Government Exhibit 52" - an address book allegedly belonging to Jeffrey Epstein. The defense raises critical authentication and chain-of-custody issues.

The defense argues two fundamental flaws: (1) The government's cooperating witness could not have seen this address book during her employment with Epstein because the source (Alfredo Rodriguez) was fired in 2004, before the witness began working; (2) The book was clearly altered by Rodriguez, who possessed it from 2004-2009 before attempting to sell it for $50,000.

The defense emphasizes highly suspicious circumstances: Rodriguez knew his sale target (attorney Brad Edwards) was part of a law firm under federal investigation for a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme that specifically involved falsifying documents and making false allegations against Epstein. This created powerful incentive to alter the address book to increase its value.

The defense argues the government cannot meet Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a)'s basic authentication requirement. The book contains "numerous handwritten notations, added tabs, and additional handwritten pages" of unknown origin, and the proffered witness lacks personal knowledge under FRE 602.

The defense requests: (1) preclusion of any discussion of the book until proper foundation is established, (2) production of the entire book for inspection, and (3) opportunity for voir dire of the authenticating witness.

This motion reveals the defense strategy of aggressively challenging documentary evidence, particularly items with questionable provenance that passed through hands of individuals with potential motives to alter them. The letter also highlights the broader pattern of allegedly fabricated evidence related to Epstein allegations.

Also included is a November 6, 2020 certification regarding failed negotiations to extend discovery deadlines for production of data from Epstein's electronic devices.
