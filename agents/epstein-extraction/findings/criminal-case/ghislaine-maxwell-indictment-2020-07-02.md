## Key Quotes

**Overview:**
"The charges set forth herein stem from the role of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein." (page 1)

"The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18." (page 1)

**Grooming Methodology:**
"MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their families." (page 3)

"Having developed a rapport with a victim, MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor victim and Epstein." (page 3)

"MAXWELL's presence during minor victims' interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman was present." (page 3-4)

**Facilitation:**
"MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims." (page 4)

"As a result, victims were made to feel indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to help them." (page 4)

**Direct Participation:**
"In some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims." (page 4)

"MAXWELL involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein." (page 8)

## Summary

The original indictment against Ghislaine Maxwell, filed July 2, 2020, charged her with six federal counts: conspiracy to entice minors to travel for illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor, and two counts of perjury from 2016 depositions.

The indictment alleges Maxwell was instrumental in a sophisticated grooming operation targeting girls as young as 14 between 1994-1997. The document describes a methodical pattern: Maxwell would first befriend victims by asking about their lives and families, then normalize sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of them, and being present during sexual encounters. Her presence as an adult woman was specifically designed to put young victims at ease.

Three minor victims are identified: Minor Victim-1 (met at age 14, groomed 1994-1997, abused in NY/FL), Minor Victim-2 (flown to New Mexico ranch in 1996), and Minor Victim-3 (groomed in London 1994-1995, introduced to Epstein).

Maxwell allegedly participated directly in abuse including group sexualized massages, encouraged victims to provide sexualized massages to Epstein, and facilitated interstate travel of minors for sexual purposes. The indictment emphasizes both Maxwell and Epstein knew the victims were under 18.

The perjury counts stem from April and July 2016 depositions in civil case 15 Civ. 7344, where Maxwell made false statements denying knowledge of Epstein's recruitment scheme, denying awareness of sex toys, and falsely denying ever giving massages.

Abuse occurred at multiple Epstein properties: Upper East Side Manhattan townhouse, Palm Beach Florida estate, Santa Fe New Mexico ranch, and Maxwell's London residence.
