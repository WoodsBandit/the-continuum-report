### Rule 16 Obligations - Case-in-Chief vs. Impeachment

"Rule 16(b) expressly requires disclosure of items the defense 'intends to use . . . in the defendant's case-in-chief at trial.' Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(A)." (page 1)

"The defendant's 'case in chief' is not a formalist term for the events that begin the moment the Government rests. Rather, 'where a defendant cross-examines a government witness to buttress her theory of the case, rather than to impeach the testimony given by the witness on direct examination, the cross-examination is properly seen as part of the defendant's case-in-chief.'" (pages 1-2, quoting United States v. Napout)

"[T]his interpretation of Rule 16 has been adopted by almost every district court to consider the issue." (page 2)

"Accordingly, the rule 'requires [the defense] to identify all non-impeachment exhibits they intend to use in their defense at trial, whether the exhibits will be introduced through a government witness or a witness called by [the defense].'" (page 2, quoting Napout)

### Policy Rationale

"A contrary rule would 'permit defendants to evade pretrial disclosure simply by presenting much (or all) of their case-in-chief before the government rests,' thereby 'frustrat[ing] the practical intentions behind Rule 16: to avoid unfair surprise and unwarranted delay by providing both the government and the defense with a broad, reciprocal right to discovery.'" (page 2, quoting United States v. Crowder)

### Good Cause Requirement

"To be clear, good cause is not established simply because the defense has not made a final determination as to what evidence they intend to introduce—a position that effectively renders Rule 16 a nullity." (page 3, footnote, quoting United States v. Rajaratnam)

"A defendant would always like more information about the government's case before revealing anything about his or her own, but Rule 16 conditions a defendant's disclosure obligations on the government's having made certain specified disclosures, not on the government's laying open its entire case or the defendant's satisfaction." (page 3, footnote, quoting Rajaratnam)

### Impeachment - Extrinsic Evidence Limitations

"[A]s a general matter, 'extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness's conduct in order to attack or support the witness's character for truthfulness.' Fed. R. Evid. 608(b)." (page 3)

"The Rules also permit 'other grounds of impeachment (such as contradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias, and mental capacity).'" (page 3, quoting Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) Advisory Committee Notes)

"But even then, '[e]xtrinsic evidence offered for impeachment on a collateral issue is properly excluded.'" (page 3, quoting United States v. Purdy)

"[T]he Second Circuit has held . . . that introduction of extrinsic proof of a prior inconsistent statement is only appropriate as it relates to matters which are not collateral, i.e., as to those matters which are relevant to the issues in the case and could be independently proven." (page 3, quoting United States v. Dore)

### Government's Request

"Accordingly, the defense should be precluded from offering further exhibits that have not been turned over to the Government absent (a) a showing of cause for the delayed disclosure, or (b) an articulation of a theory by which they are admissible impeachment notwithstanding Rule 608 and the collateral-matter bar." (page 4)

## Summary

This government letter, filed November 30, 2021, addresses a critical pretrial dispute over the defense's obligation to disclose exhibits they intended to use at trial. The government argued that the defense was attempting to circumvent Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16's disclosure requirements by labeling defense exhibits as "impeachment" when they actually constituted part of the defense case-in-chief.

The government's key legal arguments:

**1. Definition of "Case-in-Chief":** The defense's "case in chief" is not limited to evidence presented after the government rests. When the defense cross-examines government witnesses "to buttress her theory of the case, rather than to impeach the testimony given by the witness on direct examination," that cross-examination is properly considered part of the defense case-in-chief subject to Rule 16 disclosure requirements.

**2. Mandatory Disclosure:** Rule 16 requires the defense to "identify all non-impeachment exhibits they intend to use in their defense at trial, whether the exhibits will be introduced through a government witness or a witness called by [the defense]." This interpretation has been "adopted by almost every district court to consider the issue."

**3. Policy Rationale:** A contrary rule would allow defendants to evade pretrial disclosure by presenting their entire case before the government rests, "frustrat[ing] the practical intentions behind Rule 16: to avoid unfair surprise and unwarranted delay."

**4. Deadline Compliance:** The defense's Rule 16 disclosures were due November 8, 2021. Any exhibits intended as part of the defense case-in-chief should have been disclosed then. Good cause for belated disclosure is not established merely because "the defense has not made a final determination" about what evidence to introduce.

**5. Impeachment Limits:** Even if exhibits are offered for impeachment, Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) generally prohibits extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of conduct to attack truthfulness. While exceptions exist for prior inconsistent statements (FRE 613) and other grounds like contradiction, bias, and mental capacity, "[e]xtrinsic evidence offered for impeachment on a collateral issue is properly excluded."

The government requested that the defense be precluded from offering additional exhibits not previously disclosed unless: (a) the defense shows good cause for delayed disclosure, or (b) the defense articulates a specific theory for admissibility as impeachment that overcomes Rule 608 and the collateral-matter bar.

This letter reveals the government's concern that the defense was planning extensive cross-examination using undisclosed documents, attempting to avoid disclosure requirements by characterizing the evidence as impeachment rather than affirmative defense evidence.
