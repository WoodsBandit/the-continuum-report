## Polish Fixes

### BUG-020: Equal Node Size (FIX14)

**Prompt File:** `Prompts/FIX14_EQUAL_NODE_SIZE.md`

**Problem:** Epstein node larger than others (should be equal)

**File:** `website/continuum.html` (~line 4480-4520)

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
grep -ni "epstein\|nodeSize\|radius\|focal" /mnt/user/continuum/website/continuum.html | head -30
```

**Quick Fix:**
- Remove any ID-based size variations
- Remove connection-count-based sizing
- Set fixed radius for all nodes: `const radius = 25;`
- Keep gold ring for selected node (that's just UI feedback)

**Test:** All person nodes same size, no ID-based scaling

---

### BUG-021: Inconsistent Navigation

**Problem:** Different pages have different nav structures

**Files:** All HTML pages

**Quick Fix:**
- Standardize navigation across all pages
- Create shared nav component or copy consistent HTML
- Ensure same links in same order on all pages

**Test:** All pages have identical nav structure

### BUG-022: Console Errors - Cloudflare Beacon

**Problem:** Minor — Cloudflare analytics errors in console

**Note:** This may be resolved by fixing BUG-001 (tunnel stability). If errors persist:

**Quick Fix:**
- Check if beacon.min.js is loading correctly
- May need to update Cloudflare analytics script
- Can be ignored if non-blocking

**Test:** No console errors on page load

---

### BUG-023: Homepage Large Empty Space

**Problem:** Confusing scroll gap between sections

**File:** `website/index.html`

**Diagnosis:**
- Inspect "The Zoom Framework" section in browser dev tools
- Look for excessive margin/padding
- Check for missing content

**Quick Fix:**
- Reduce padding/margin on framework section
- Add content if section is meant to have more
- Adjust CSS grid/flexbox spacing

**Test:** Smooth scroll with no excessive gaps

---

### BUG-024: Missing og:image

**Problem:** Social sharing preview may be broken

**File:** `website/index.html` (line 18)

**Quick Fix:**
1. Create og-image.jpg (1200x630px recommended)
   - Screenshot of site or custom graphic
   - Save to `/website/og-image.jpg`
2. OR remove the meta tag if no image available

**Test:** Share URL on social media - preview image appears

---

### BUG-025: Legal Page Effective Date

**Problem:** Minor — outdated date reference

**File:** `website/legal.html` (lines 597-598)

**Quick Fix:**
- Update if standards have changed
- OR leave as-is if standards unchanged since December 2024

**Test:** Date reflects last actual standards update
