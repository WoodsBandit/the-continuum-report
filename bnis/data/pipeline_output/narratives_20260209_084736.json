      "narrative": "I see this is The Continuum Report project. The system message mentioned I'm writing for this publication. However, I notice my conversation doesn't yet have a specific task from the user - the system message just established context.\n\nLet me wait for the user's actual request. The message \"You are writing for The Continuum Report, an independent intelligence analysis publication.\" appears to be context-setting rather than a task.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with for The Continuum Report? Based on the project state, I can see:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Infrastructure migration to WoodsDen is in progress\n- Docker services pending restart\n- 288+ briefs exist, 2,008+ entities tracked, 70 connections documented\n\n**Active Priorities:**\n1. Start Docker services after restart\n2. Test Paperless OCR and BNIS pipeline\n3. Content: Update Wexner brief, Connection Brief Overseer Phase 2\n\nWhat task should I focus on?",
