    "extraction_summary": "This document is OCC Consent Order #2013-002 (Case AA-EC-13-04) dated January 14, 2013, against three JPMorgan Chase subsidiary banks for BSA/AML compliance deficiencies. The order identifies 22 individuals (OCC officials and bank board members who signed), 12 organizations, 8 locations, key dates, and numerous legal/regulatory document references. The banks were found to have inadequate internal controls, deficient customer due diligence, failures in suspicious activity reporting, and inadequate OFAC compliance. The order requires establishment of a Compliance Committee, comprehensive BSA/AML action plans, SAR look-backs, and enhanced monitoring systems."
