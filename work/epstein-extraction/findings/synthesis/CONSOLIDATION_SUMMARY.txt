- These false positives can be filtered in subsequent phases
- The consolidation successfully captured all major persons, organizations, and locations mentioned across the 100 source documents
- Entity names were cleaned of markdown formatting, parenthetical notes, and contextual descriptions
- File citations are provided for each entity showing which documents contain mentions

NEXT STEPS

1. Cross-referencing entities across documents
2. Building relationship maps
3. Timeline correlation
4. Master entity database creation
